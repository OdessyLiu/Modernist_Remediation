# Modernist Remediation: Deciphering the Graphic Biography Genre with Goodreads Data
 
This project uses **Digital Humanities (DH)** methods to investigate the genre of **Graphic Biographies** perceived by the readers with **Goodreads review** data and metadata. 

This project is a sub-project of *‚ÄúModernist Remediations: Embodiment, Technology, and Cultural Memory‚Äù* of the ReMedia Lab, UBC Okanagan. 

## Project Overview

Graphic Biographies are biographical stories narrated in the graphic novel or comics format. How do the readers connect with the book and the subjects of the biographies emotionally through the new genre of image-text narrative? This project aims to answer this broad question with Goodreads review data. 

Also, about a quater of graphic biographies feature figures from the early-twentieth century; we would like to reveal how the genre and artistic format mediate the perception the specific modernist figures with evaluative and affective book reviews. 

**Research Questions**

This project seeks to answer the following research questions *(ongoing)*:

- Do readers explicitly combine evaluation with emotion in reviews of graphic biography?
- What vocabulary do they use when they do so?

**Status**

This project is **in progress**.

### To reproduce

#### 1. Scrape reviews

The scraper is located in the [Scraper/](Scraper) folder. Please download the folder and follow the [README](Scraper/README.md) file. 

- **Requirements:** Python 3.10 and dependencies, see [README](Scraper/README.md) file
- **Setup:**
  - Create and activate a virtual environment (conda/venv).
  - `cd` to the scraper's folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Goodreads IDs:** To run the scraper, you will need the Goodreads IDs for the books, which are stored in the [metadata files](Data/Goodreads_Comics_Data/Data_Files).
- **Review cleaning:** To clean the reviews and calculate the review statistics, please see [Analysis/Reviews_CleaningStatistics.ipynb](Analysis/Reviews_CleaningStatistics.ipynb).

#### 2. Emotion analysis and keyness analysis

This experiment aims to investigate the readers' emotional response toward the graphic biographies books, the books' subjects, and the genre, reflected in the book reviews. 

The detailed experiment is located in the [Analysis/Emotion&Keyness/](Analysis/Emotion&Keyness) folder.
