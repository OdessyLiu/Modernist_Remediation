Julie,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9746341-julie,3,"July 31, 2024",I'm a Prince fanatic so I couldn't resist a graphic novel biography. Some of the art is brilliant. The content is organized in chronological order and is mostly in line with Prince's own reflections and what has been shared in previous biographies. It could be translation issues but often the tone is off-putting. A few of the sections felt sensationalistic.,2,"['art', 'non-fiction']"
Erin,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3592034-erin,3,"April 29, 2024","2.5 stars. FILLED with some problematic assumptions, casual sexism, etc. and I didn’t really love any of the illustration styles. But, I dug how this was organized and that it captured the many different facets of Prince.",2,[]

Theediscerning,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31778097-theediscerning,2,"July 6, 2023","Hmmm… This was never going to be the most beautiful book in the world, and diamonds or pearls were probably a pipe dream. It is naff. What it acts as is an unofficial biography of The Purple One, albeit a bodged effort. We get a chapter of his story in graphic novel form, each time by a different artist on the race to be the worst here, apparently, and then get pretty much the same material in subjective prose. Either that or the prose is repeated in the comic sections, and you can soon lose count of the times something is mentioned in one that needs the explanatory benefit of the other genre (Goldn----a perhaps prime in that).Every album is a complete renaissance, the best since the last one (even when it was a triple album of stodge, or given away free with a newspaper and the bane of charity shops for years after). Every tour is a highlight of the universe. All the while, The Twinz are spelled wrong, Goldn---a is two words and not one, and, er, the musical instrument bass gets an 'e'. The Bangles get insulted. At least in the format I saw it, of e-arc, it is a lot of work from being as it should.So who is it for? Fans know this stuff, and those few left can sing and rap all the triple albums of stodge in their sleep, and know all the ins and outs of the NPG staffers like their own family tree. Curious browsers will find something inherently interesting, if shoddily done, biased to the high heavens, and really not up to scratch where the visuals are concerned. Being half-prose is just a major irritant to the graphic novel fan, too – meaning this will fall down everywhere it steps. You might guess it's a disappointment.",0,[]
Alicia,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia,3,"July 5, 2024","As I mentioned in the Queen in Comics, I dislike the approach the series take interspersing the comics with the prose to tell the story- I want them to choose one or the other and for the graphic chapters, to have one illustrator. Other than the issue in format presentation, I like that I learn about the artist, the music industry itself, and how musicians make it in the world whether it's record deals to spending their money, and living their life. Prince was certainly a character as evidenced by things like his ever-evolving style, name, relationships, and music. And his studio/home that he died in from an opioid overdose, I've driven by in Minnesota. It sometimes overshadowed the talented musician that he was. And I loved that it featured the epic Super Bowl performance. It's a motto I take to heart- when things are going wrong (the torrential downpour)- Prince asked ""Can we make it rain harder?"" Lean into it and make it epic. That's what he did.",0,"['adult', 'amexperience', 'artsy']"
MK,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61667429-mk,3,"March 14, 2024","Not a great start to the book, describing Prince's mom as a woman ""who clearly took good care of herself."" Thankfully that was the end of the casual sexism. (WTF does that even mean, anyway? It's not an expression women use.) The rest of the book follows this series' structure of breaking the subject's life into sections and have a different artist draw each one. The artwork is superb and it's a pretty comprehensive look into Prince's artistry and his mentorship of other artists, primarily women. (Pretty surprised Judith Hill, the last one in the line, isn't mentioned with the rest.) I learned a bunch of things I didn't know and was reminded of the songs I really loved. I just wish I hadn't had to be on guard while reading for more sexism. Took a star off for that.",0,[]
Kyle Casello,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/167446264-kyle-casello,4,"January 3, 2024","This is definitely a read for Prince fans! Although if you have followed his career it doesn’t present anything new, which is ok. This is a celebration of a musician’s life and the music he left behind. Highlights are the chapters on Sheila E, the creation of Paisley Park and the Super Bowl Halftime show. It’s very interesting seeing the different artists take on each era of Prince and even introducing us to new artists.",0,[]
Rachel,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/164576566-rachel,3,"August 26, 2024","This book felt a little repetitive with the text pages over-explaining what happened in the previous chapter. I wasn't too crazy about any of the art styles, and it felt like it overlooked a lot of negative things that were also part of the story (really idolizing Prince). Some of the language just felt cheesy.",0,[]

Stacy,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38623960-stacy,3,"March 2, 2024",3.5 - liked the story and artwork. I didn't need the explanatory sections in-between each period. It felt like it duplicated what I'd already read.,0,[]
Shebbles,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/148714657-shebbles,4,"March 12, 2024",Good overview for fans or folks interested in Prince. He was one freaky genius who was gone too soon.,0,[]
GONZA,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,4,"December 12, 2023","Prince's life divided into years and with different illustrators for each section. A very apt choice that also conveys through the features peculiar to each artist, the multidimensionality of the Minneapolis genius. Beautiful Graphic Novel, too bad about the ending....La vita di Prince divisa in anni e con disegnatori diversi per ogni sezione. Una scelta azzeccatissima che trasmette anche attraverso i tratti peculiari ad ogni artista, la multidimensionalità del genio di Minneapolis. Bella Graphic Novel, peccato il finale....I received from the Publisher a complimentary digital advanced review copy of the book in exchange for a honest review.",0,[]
