It is and will always be a striking example of how actually shitty the Indian social structure is. It speaks volumes about being a woman in India. It speaks volumes about caste. It is a necessary story. It is a story which really traumatised me, not kidding, and I had to take whole week-long breaks or just shut the book to not completely depress myself. If this was a normal story, I would blame just how depressing this is. This is not my style. But this is a true story.I will be honest, this was not something I enjoyed. It is very very depressing. But it is also a story of immense power and perseverence and sheer fucking will. I really liked that Claire didn't focus on all the sexual abuse and instead focused on the emotional trauma. It is a very scarring story but it is a necessary one. I really don't have words that do justice to this story. I really really suggest everyone to read this tho because it tells so much about caste and womanhood. It is very insightful as to how Indian women think about marriage sex and so on, especially the deprived classes. An important story, told well, but still so scarring I just yeah.

Definite TW for rape and severe violence though. I had never heard of Phoolan Devi - not at school, from my parents or even anywhere tbh. (We do enjoy relegating women to the void of history don't we?). Phoolan's story isn't so unique, child bride, rape, men using her chattel etc. Fairly normal - but her ability to keep going? Everyone likes to pretend that the caste system is a thing of the past (it's not) and it's a thread that runs right through this graphic novel. Phoolan's ability to move beyond those casre lines and to become a champion of ppl was amazing to read. Her challenging what was acceptable for a woman to be and become was mindblowing tbh - more so because it's all true.",2,[]

Eduardo Santiago,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,4,"January 1, 2023","A beautiful, accessible way to tell a difficult and (in the U.S.) unknown story. I had never heard of Devi, and that’s a shame: she deserves to be known and celebrated.This is a violent book, TW everything. “Violence is not the answer,” some people proclaim, but I firmly believe it is part of the answer process, often a crucially necessary one. I feel fury over the trauma inflicted on Devi and countless others like her, but my fury does nothing to prevent it from happening again and again today and tomorrow. Heroes like Devi: they help, and, more importantly, inspire others. It was cathartic to see her neutralize those who hurt her and would hurt others. We need more of that.Finally: this graphic-novel adaptation is clearly oversimplified, with an almost infantile tone at times—perhaps to reinforce Devi’s own lost innocence? In any case, this is not a book for children. Also, the adaptation is based on Devi’s autobiography. There may be biases. There may be more to her story, some of it less flattering to her, some of it possibly ambiguous. Almost as if she was a real, complex human being. I still think this is worth reading: much as I love objective truth, a little hagiography is OK from time to time, and everything I’ve found in my followup reading tonight suggests that she was a worthy person.",0,[]

Dustyloup,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3538898-dustyloup,5,"April 11, 2020","As I was reading I was thinking that there was something familiar about the art style... Oh yes, La guerre de Catherine! The way that Fauvel draws facial expressions is great, I can feel the emotions of the people. I was surprised by another review that said the drawing was weak in some parts - for me the ugliness is part of the narrative. I particularly liked in the beginning when a lot of the men looked like they have black eyes. Anyway, this is a loose adaptation of Devi's memoir, Moi, Phoolan Devi, Reine des Bandits, which I have not read yet. I learned about Phoolan Devi for the first time through Culottées #2: Des femmes qui ne font que ce qu'elles veulent. Not sure how I missed the Bandit Queen movie or even the news of her assassination in 2001. Sadly, if you read Culottées in English (Brazen: Rebel Ladies Who Rocked The World), you would have missed her story because, as I understand the rape/aka her lived experience was deemed too sensive. I think you have to understand graphic novels and know that this is not a kid's book, even though she is a heroic figure and her actions were done in defense of women and the poor. There's nudity, rape, blood, and killing, but it's not presented in a gratuitous way. I really don't like stories about thugs and criminals, so if I give it five stars it's to show how sensitive Fauvel was in her treatment of the story. If you're for a children's book, check out La Guerre de Catherine instead!",0,[]

But it is also a story of immense power and perseverence and sheer fucking will. I really liked that Claire didn't focus on all the sexual abuse and instead focused on the emotional trauma. It is a very scarring story but it is a necessary one. I really don't have words that do justice to this story. I really really suggest everyone to read this tho because it tells so much about caste and womanhood. It is very insightful as to how Indian women think about marriage sex and so on, especially the deprived classes. An important story, told well, but still so scarring I just yeah.

Definite TW for rape and severe violence though. I had never heard of Phoolan Devi - not at school, from my parents or even anywhere tbh. (We do enjoy relegating women to the void of history don't we?). Phoolan's story isn't so unique, child bride, rape, men using her chattel etc. Fairly normal - but her ability to keep going? Everyone likes to pretend that the caste system is a thing of the past (it's not) and it's a thread that runs right through this graphic novel. Phoolan's ability to move beyond those casre lines and to become a champion of ppl was amazing to read. Her challenging what was acceptable for a woman to be and become was mindblowing tbh - more so because it's all true.",2,[]

I had never heard of Devi, and that’s a shame: she deserves to be known and celebrated.This is a violent book, TW everything. “Violence is not the answer,” some people proclaim, but I firmly believe it is part of the answer process, often a crucially necessary one. I feel fury over the trauma inflicted on Devi and countless others like her, but my fury does nothing to prevent it from happening again and again today and tomorrow. Heroes like Devi: they help, and, more importantly, inspire others. It was cathartic to see her neutralize those who hurt her and would hurt others. We need more of that.Finally: this graphic-novel adaptation is clearly oversimplified, with an almost infantile tone at times—perhaps to reinforce Devi’s own lost innocence? In any case, this is not a book for children. Also, the adaptation is based on Devi’s autobiography. There may be biases. There may be more to her story, some of it less flattering to her, some of it possibly ambiguous. Almost as if she was a real, complex human being. I still think this is worth reading: much as I love objective truth, a little hagiography is OK from time to time, and everything I’ve found in my followup reading tonight suggests that she was a worthy person.",0,[]

Oh yes, La guerre de Catherine! The way that Fauvel draws facial expressions is great, I can feel the emotions of the people. I was surprised by another review that said the drawing was weak in some parts - for me the ugliness is part of the narrative. I particularly liked in the beginning when a lot of the men looked like they have black eyes. Anyway, this is a loose adaptation of Devi's memoir, Moi, Phoolan Devi, Reine des Bandits, which I have not read yet. I learned about Phoolan Devi for the first time through Culottées #2: Des femmes qui ne font que ce qu'elles veulent. Not sure how I missed the Bandit Queen movie or even the news of her assassination in 2001. Sadly, if you read Culottées in English (Brazen: Rebel Ladies Who Rocked The World), you would have missed her story because, as I understand the rape/aka her lived experience was deemed too sensive. I think you have to understand graphic novels and know that this is not a kid's book, even though she is a heroic figure and her actions were done in defense of women and the poor. There's nudity, rape, blood, and killing, but it's not presented in a gratuitous way. I really don't like stories about thugs and criminals, so if I give it five stars it's to show how sensitive Fauvel was in her treatment of the story.

It does a lot more than just portray her as the modern female mix of Che Guevara and Robin Hood that other tellings do, but instead covers her entire back story, including a surprisingly graphic portrayal of her being raped as a child bride. However, that raises issues – the design of the book is bound to attract young readers, with its bright colours, simplified text trying to be in her own young voice, and frankly bizarre times when she gets cats' pupils in her eyes, and this came with only the smallest of back-cover warnings suggesting the young should pass this by.So we get a full gamut of abuse, from the caste system, and due to men being men (allegedly), and multiple times by rape. Rather naively it aims to adapt the autobiography Devi narrated, without questioning it, and rather naively it tries to present the whole thing without a counterpoint actually asking if she was in the right to do what she did. But I think I still enjoyed this – the narrative drive is powerful, the issues are conveyed very well, and it all looks good. There are some serious problems with eyes – some people don't even get given them, for one – but that is another minor flaw that can be glossed over with such strong storytelling.",0,[]

There is definitely other violence, and additional sexual violence as well, but that one was especially raw and explicit.Violence isn't really my cup of tea, but this is a biographical tale. So the rawness of those experiences directly and deeply impact the rest of Phoolan's life. She is so severely traumatized -- and stigmatized -- that when she is kidnapped by bandits and finds a man who is actually kind and considerate toward her, she falls in with their band without much reservation. And ultimately she leads it. And there is really no question that her cause is just. She and her band of dacoits fight against exploitation and poverty, and Phoolan herself is a fierce opponent of the oppression of women. But this righteous fire ultimately leads to more violence. Phoolan Devi lived from 1963 to 2001. So her story is very recent history. This rendition is based on her own words, uncontextualized and uncorroborated.

I heard a few things about her when I was a kid and I can still vividly remember adults whispering about her, keeping mum when we kids were around and didn't say anything when we kids asked about her. Talking about her was like a forbidden topic. And when the movie based on her life came out, I still remember all that people including my classmates talked was how the movie featured some adult rated scenes and how the actress was completely naked on screen. Yes, that's the sad part. And so I wasn't much aware about the life of Phoolan Devi inspite of getting confused why she was celebrated and hated at the same time.

Je connaissais la vie de Phoolan Devi pour avoir lu d'autres textes sur elle, mais je dois avouer avoir dû prendre des pauses.Outre ces remarques, la BD semble s'inspirer en grande partie des mémoires de Phoolan Devi, quitte à prendre ses remarques textuellement pour les récitatifs (phylactères du narrateur). La BD est superbement dessinée, plein de détails, capture définitivement bien les paysages indiens, les personnages, les lieux, les contrastes entre pauvreté et richesse, etc. Très très crue par moment aussi bien que l'angle d'approche permet de ne pas être trop explicite tout en respectant une certaine importance de proximité narrative. L'histoire est bien racontée (elle s'arrête au moment de sa libération) et réussi à résumer plusieurs années en quelques pages sans avoir l'impression de voir trop d'ellipses temporelles. Bref, un excellent ouvrage d'introduction au personnage de Phoolan.

It shouldn't come as a surprise, but there are trigger warnings in here for rape and abuse. Phoolan was married of at the age of 11, and raped by her 30+ year old husband. And yes, you see this and it is heart wrenching. But she goes through so much more, and the way she manages to pick herself up and take fate in her own hands every time again is admirable. And it angers and saddens me that what she did was the only solution to her, and how common and recent her experiences are. This is an important and impactful story and for that alone I would give it a 5* rating.But... the execution isn't great. Her actions are never questioned for one (I don't know if it is the author's place to do so, but I would have like to see something). The art in this isn't the best either.

I had never heard of Devi, and that’s a shame: she deserves to be known and celebrated.This is a violent book, TW everything. “Violence is not the answer,” some people proclaim, but I firmly believe it is part of the answer process, often a crucially necessary one. I feel fury over the trauma inflicted on Devi and countless others like her, but my fury does nothing to prevent it from happening again and again today and tomorrow. Heroes like Devi: they help, and, more importantly, inspire others. It was cathartic to see her neutralize those who hurt her and would hurt others. We need more of that.Finally: this graphic-novel adaptation is clearly oversimplified, with an almost infantile tone at times—perhaps to reinforce Devi’s own lost innocence? In any case, this is not a book for children. Also, the adaptation is based on Devi’s autobiography. There may be biases. There may be more to her story, some of it less flattering to her, some of it possibly ambiguous. Almost as if she was a real, complex human being. I still think this is worth reading: much as I love objective truth, a little hagiography is OK from time to time, and everything I’ve found in my followup reading tonight suggests that she was a worthy person.",0,[]

Oh yes, La guerre de Catherine! The way that Fauvel draws facial expressions is great, I can feel the emotions of the people. I was surprised by another review that said the drawing was weak in some parts - for me the ugliness is part of the narrative. I particularly liked in the beginning when a lot of the men looked like they have black eyes. Anyway, this is a loose adaptation of Devi's memoir, Moi, Phoolan Devi, Reine des Bandits, which I have not read yet. I learned about Phoolan Devi for the first time through Culottées #2: Des femmes qui ne font que ce qu'elles veulent. Not sure how I missed the Bandit Queen movie or even the news of her assassination in 2001. Sadly, if you read Culottées in English (Brazen: Rebel Ladies Who Rocked The World), you would have missed her story because, as I understand the rape/aka her lived experience was deemed too sensive. I think you have to understand graphic novels and know that this is not a kid's book, even though she is a heroic figure and her actions were done in defense of women and the poor. There's nudity, rape, blood, and killing, but it's not presented in a gratuitous way. I really don't like stories about thugs and criminals, so if I give it five stars it's to show how sensitive Fauvel was in her treatment of the story.

It does a lot more than just portray her as the modern female mix of Che Guevara and Robin Hood that other tellings do, but instead covers her entire back story, including a surprisingly graphic portrayal of her being raped as a child bride. However, that raises issues – the design of the book is bound to attract young readers, with its bright colours, simplified text trying to be in her own young voice, and frankly bizarre times when she gets cats' pupils in her eyes, and this came with only the smallest of back-cover warnings suggesting the young should pass this by.So we get a full gamut of abuse, from the caste system, and due to men being men (allegedly), and multiple times by rape. Rather naively it aims to adapt the autobiography Devi narrated, without questioning it, and rather naively it tries to present the whole thing without a counterpoint actually asking if she was in the right to do what she did. But I think I still enjoyed this – the narrative drive is powerful, the issues are conveyed very well, and it all looks good.

There is definitely other violence, and additional sexual violence as well, but that one was especially raw and explicit.Violence isn't really my cup of tea, but this is a biographical tale. So the rawness of those experiences directly and deeply impact the rest of Phoolan's life. She is so severely traumatized -- and stigmatized -- that when she is kidnapped by bandits and finds a man who is actually kind and considerate toward her, she falls in with their band without much reservation. And ultimately she leads it. And there is really no question that her cause is just. She and her band of dacoits fight against exploitation and poverty, and Phoolan herself is a fierce opponent of the oppression of women. But this righteous fire ultimately leads to more violence. Phoolan Devi lived from 1963 to 2001. So her story is very recent history. This rendition is based on her own words, uncontextualized and uncorroborated.

When a neighbor cut down a tree, she wanted justice. At the age of only 11, she was married off to a man much older than her and raped. This was only the beginning of the degrading things that happened to her.

TinySalutations,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58553276-tinysalutations,5,"March 7, 2022","This was hard to put down despite being hard to read. Please be careful if you have any triggers to sexual assault. It is not once off-scene. It happens repeatedly and is a key element of the storyline. Also, it is drawn somewhat within frame, maybe not all of it, but depending how sensitive you are to this topic it could be intense. I loved Phoolan Devi though. I loved how enduring, emotionally strong, and adaptive she is. I love that she lets her anger loose, but still in a somewhat controlled way. I loved that she was brave enough to love despite everything. I had NO idea that this story took place in 1970s-2001! I assumed it was a long time ago before I started, so that blew my mind. I’m sad that this was (is?) the quality of women’s lives in India. Her story did remind me slightly of two other women’s general storyline of join bandits, marry, death, queen, leave: Zheng Yi Sao and Wang Cong’er. The artist and storyteller did a great job bringing this together in a engaging way that is readable and makes you feel like you really need to know what’s next.",0,[]

Cela dit, j’ai trouvé son trait très inégal pour les visages, qu’on peine parfois à reconnaître ou différencier. Ça se lit cependant d’une traite, la boule au ventre et se dire que c’est une bonne lecture du soir est probablement un peu ambitieux ; le côté assez simple du dessin est en contraste avec le sujet traité, et même si on sous-entend certaines des horreurs, on ne nous épargne pas grand-chose. Pour le reste, c’est un récit brutal, dur, terrible, une biographie marquante, traitant d’un sujet que je ne connaissais pas du tout ; et fait rare, m’a presque donné l’envie de lire la version « autobiographique » de Devi (narrée, puisqu’elle était elle-même analphabète). Les choix faits dans la narration et leur importance n’est pas toujours égal, mais le sujet est maîtrisé et le message passe – on finit par se demander, aussi, combien ont été celles qui n’ont pas su, ou pu, se lever et prendre les armes.",0,"['01-2024', '20-non-fiction', '20-roman-graphique']"

I thought I would be heartened on a day that looks so bleak for women by the idea that young women would rise up as Phoolan Devi did in the face of hardship... this was a very, very bad idea, and I honestly can't imagine anyone not being traumatized or demoralized by her story on any day on which they learn of it. I'm definitely still glad that stories like these get told, and I am pleased to have more stories about people outside of North America and Europe, but I think perhaps the format and my lack of significant knowledge of her life combined to make me not expect such horrors. That said, the graphic novel itself was beautifully done; I just think the jacket should have focused less on her being a Robin Hood figure and more on her story revealing the worst of humanity through repeated rape and abuse.",0,['read-history-bio-memoir']

I don't see myself as a good person, but I am not a criminal either. All I did what was do to men what they had done to me.""Phoolan Devi's story is riddled with the most horrifying and terrible abuse that a woman can suffer. And yet she survived, recovered, fought back with the same brutality that had been done to her. Many women in her position would have killed themselves or turn into a shell. But not Phoolan Devi. Her troubles all began when a corrupt cousin stole her family's land. She as a ten year old saw fit to take back what was hers and her family. Unlike many victims of rape and physical torture, she was able to take revenge against her abusers and tormentors and not let them get away with hurting another woman or child. The graphic novel doesn't dwell on her abuse and torture for exploitation, but neither does it spare the depiction of her suffering. It also, crucially, depicts the beauty in her character, her relationship with religion, her ability to love and to hope, and her strong will to see justice done.",0,[]

Married off at 11 and raped by her husband, Phoolan teen years are a constant litany of degradation, torment and assault. At 16, Phoolan is kidnapped by a group of bandits - dacoit; slowly but surely Phoolan finds her place and her power. Eventually heading her own gang, Devi devotes herself to righting the wrongs against girls/women and the poor by targetting with theft and violence the powerful men who feel they can do anything.",0,"['arc', 'graphicnovels-comics']"
