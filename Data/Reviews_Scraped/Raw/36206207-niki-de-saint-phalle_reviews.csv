Dave Schaafsma,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma,4,"August 27, 2018","‚ÄúI always admired people who went all out.‚Äù  Niki de Saint Phalle lived primarily in France and the U.S. Self-taught, an ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù artist, she became a kind of insider for a time in the international art world. She was a painter, sculptor and filmmaker, initially making assemblages using found household objects including broken plates. Her own Self Portrait is made of shards of glass. Saint Phalle explored the roles of women in art in society. She became famous for Shooting Pictures, in which she fired a .22 rifle into bags of paint strapped to a canvas, and the ""Nanas"", bold and colorful sculptures of voluptuous women. She also constructed The Tarot Garden, a garden filled with colorful sculptures based on Tarot card symbols, which she created over 20 years on land she acquired in Tuscany.What I like about this comics biography is that it attempts to capture the character and energy of the ‚Äúenfant terrible‚Äù Saint Phalle, through her life and art. A tumultuous life from the start, with lots of men, principally a connection with the Dadaist sculptor Jean Tinguely, and lots of bold and almost impossibly big ideas. Each chapter features her on a Tarot Card. It‚Äôs wild and fun and a little overwhelming, but I learned a lot about her and it introduces you to a lot of aspects of her life you can look into more deeply if you like. The book includes a chronology of her life and lots of resources if you want to learn more about her. Both she and her biography are full of life and color and energy.If you want to read other really ambitious comics artist biographies, the others from NBM I have read include Monet: Itinerant of Light, Thoreau: A Sublime Life, Billy Holiday, and A Girl in Dior, and they are all lovely in their own ways.

Molly,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1015287-molly,3,"April 25, 2018","I received access to this title via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I'd never heard of Niki de Saint Phalle prior to reading this graphic novel, but her monumental sculptures remind me quite a bit of a friend's work. The font choice here makes the background information a bit difficult to read, though the speech bubbles are easier going. de Saint Phalle had a fascinating life and career and this was a pleasant way to learn about her and her life. The suggested reading at the book's end definitely warrants investigation, however, since the drawings of her works don't quite capture them the same way photographs do.",4,"['2018', 'art', 'biography']"

MK,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61667429-mk,2,"January 24, 2023",I knew nothing about Niki de Saint Phalle so I have this book to thank for introducing me to her work. If only the writing was smooth. Key pieces are missing in the narrative. We see the death of her sister affect her but we only knew about the sister's existence 5 panels before. I spent the first half of the book jumping back to try and keep track of the people mentioned. The script that is her voice that takes us through the story is very hard to read on some of the panels as the black ink used for it is too close to the background to make it unreadable. I had to get a magnifying app to read these passages. Many of her significant works are just brushed by and I needed to look them up to get an idea of what they actually are. A lot of this is clarified in the chronology at the end but I shouldn't need to get there to follow the flowThe artwork is lovely and gives us a real sense of what her work is like as well as her struggles with mental health. Her physical health struggles aren't given the same artistic treatment. I wondered early why each chapter used a tarot card but that's because I knew nothing of her most obsessive work. It's a great way to introduce what happens in the chapter and is a lovely thread through the narrative. This book comes so close to being great. It is a great intro to her work though. I look forward to learning more about it.,0,[]
S. Christopher,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145709112-s-christopher,2,"March 12, 2022","So incredibly disappointing. With a figure as radical as Niki this book could have gone in so many directions yet it didn't know whether it wanted to be a children's book or something bold, complicated and dark much like de Saint Phalle's life.I suspect that the authors wanted to combine the 'childish' with the mature-much as Niki herself thought children are actually mature in their own rite-but this book is all over the map.In one section we see episodes with non-consensual sex and then fantasy. In another dealings with mental health and 'baby talk'. The illustrations themselves are nothing to write home about either. Don't get me started on the cursive print that made everything that much harder to read and didn't match the other typeface used throughout the book. Two stars for the research but even the chronology of de Saint Phalle's life skipped over hospitalizations and other darker aspects of her life. It read more like an 'in review' section than a chronology of a great figure's life.As generous as I am and as much as I wanted to like this book I couldn't wait to get through it and put it down.",0,[]

There are some early traumatizing events in her life that she had to learn to deal with. She did through a feminist style of art. She worked in many mediums, but is best known for sculptures. The book is told as a series of journal entries and color is used sparsely in the beginning of the story and saturates more later in the work.I wanted to like this more than I did, but the font choices felt cramped and made reading it difficult. I also feel like the art was kind of crude and didn't really do proper homage to this artist's works.
