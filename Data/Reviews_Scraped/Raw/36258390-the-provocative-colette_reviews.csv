Why even, then? I understand that there seemed to be a chronological effort, but we really didn’t need all the repetitive and interchangeable men.

This graphic novel does an elegant job of describing the early life and development of the woman who came to take society by storm in the late 1800's and early 1900's. A writer, before women were writers. A performer in the most scandalous of ways, back when women performing at all was a scandal in itself. It describes how as a young woman, her much older husband betrayed her trust repeatedly, both sexually and by taking credit for her writing.All in all an excellent story of it's times, perfectly combined with the lovely artwork, I can't speak for how historically accurate it might be, but it certainly inspires an interest to learn more about the subject.",0,"['2022-reading-challenge', 'comics-graphic-novels']"

Christina,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4822789-christina,3,"June 1, 2019","I came across this biography of Colette in graphic format in a thrift store of all places. The artwork is gorgeous and does well to evoke the early 20th century. I know of Colette, but wasn’t very familiar with her life apart from that she wrote risqué literature that was sometimes autobiographical, and was married to an older man.This biography gives a good quick overview of her life. It’s translated from the French, a fact I suspected as I read the introduction as I’ve found the French style of writing difficult to absorb in other books. I’ve studied all the Romance languages to varying degrees—Spanish for 12 years (middle school through college), Latin for 2 years in high school, Portuguese for a semester in college, and a little Italian through singing. I even touched on Galician Portuguese in a medieval Spanish literature class. As an adult, I’ve tried self-teaching myself some French, but it feels very different from the others, and no matter how I try, it just doesn’t click with me. I had a word-a-day French calendar, and only manage to make my French-speaking coworker break into laughter at my awful pronunciation. Then I tried the Pimsleur audio language course, which walks you through some basic information helpful to tourists, asking where a street is and such, and concludes with inviting a woman up to your hotel room. I had these audio courses in more than one language, and loaned one to a friend who said the other language led to the exact same conversation. I wonder if they all do. But I digress....The main challenge with this book for a reader not familiar with French language and culture is there are a lot of names of people and places. I think for a French reader, these would be familiar, or they could at least absorb them better in the way that even if you aren’t familiar with the Biltmore Estate, you know what the word estate means. Add to this challenge that graphic format tends to have an exceptionally fast pace, often relying on the illustrations to convey a lot of the information. While the artwork was beautiful, as the people followed similar fashions, it was hard to distinguish who was who, and not all the character are clearly introduced. It feels as though this book is for people who are already familiar with Colette’s life.It was still worth reading. I hadn’t realized just how unconventional she was for her time. She grew up in the country, and married a wealthy 34-year-old writer at the age of 20, moving to his apartment. He was known for having many affairs, and the practice didn’t end with his marriage. He encouraged her to write, and published her work under his own name, which at the time she was okay with. Colette came to take female lovers herself. After they divorced, she lived with a woman who dressed and lived as a man, something that it took me a while to realize in this book, due to it relying primarily on illustration and having only one gender pronoun at the end of the relationship, though there were references before that. Colette was also an actress, often appearing partially nude on stage. In addition to novels, she wrote newspaper articles, as well as many letters to her mother, which I imagine is tremendously helpful to biographers. She married again and at 40 gave birth to a daughter who seems to have been largely neglected. She also became lovers with her second husband’s teenage son from a previous marriage, the revelation of which ended her marriage.I haven’t read Colette’s novels. I started one at some point in my twenties, but couldn’t get into it. I might try again. I can’t help wondering if her fame and appeal are largely due to her gift for writing, or her shocking and scandalous content. I imagine it must be both, as I’m sure there are many smutty books that weren’t well written that are now lost in the past. At any rate, I think I might try her first novel, Claudine at School about her girlhood in the French countryside, and possibly continue through the other Claudine novels, or jump to her later work The Ripening Seed.",0,"['biography', 'graphic-format']"
Kend,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6854780-kend,3,"September 17, 2018","I'm always excited to see a good comic book biography flit across my shelves; there are some truly beautiful ones making their way into library collections and onto bookstore shelves at the moment, and The Provocative Colette is part of this ongoing trend. This is perhaps not the strongest example; the language felt a bit stilted, as if the translation's accuracy had been privileged over readability, and the art style is attractive but not quite pushing the envelope. That is, this volume is constrained by the shared challenges facing all illustrated biographies—limited page-space, the difficult balance between text and image, and a need to impress readers on all fronts—and it doesn't really rise above them. The best picture book biographies, in my opinion, use one moment to access a person's larger story ... but Goetzinger tries to cover several decades of Colette's life, which as other reviewers have already pointed out, requires the book to progress at a blistering pace to cover all of the various important events. All this to say, this is an accomplished piece of illustrated nonfiction, but it is not necessarily entertaining.

I skimmed through most of the pages, but didn't feel I missed much. There was literally speech bubbles that just said ""blah, blah, blah""; and many highlights were just suddenly told like she discovered her 1st husband's mistress and was just sad for a bit but decided to overlook it as long as she could live in the country and write books for him to publish under his name. Then at some point she agrees to have an affair with one of his mistresses, and start acting in burlesque shows. All things that could have been provocative moments but just fell flat because Collette supposedly had little choice in these decisions or even seemed to enjoy them, just doing whatever her ""master"" allowed until she fell for some new lover, all the while supposedly having massive success as an author, screen & stage writer. She didn't seem provocative, more sad & used.But the artwork is divine, definitely transported me to early 1900 Paris and made me want to read Collette's work.",0,"['2023-goodreads-challenge', 'groovy-graphics', 'library-loans']"

I understand that Colette is an icon for reclaiming female sexuality, but this felt more exploitative than celebratory.I actually went into this with a fairly strong dislike of Colette, mostly from my experience reading La Vagabonde (which is partially autobiographical) and absolutely HATING the protagonist. This book certainly didn't make me like her more, but I definitely respect the hell out of her now. I was mostly compelled to finish it because of the side ""characters"" (they were real people, so not sure how to refer to them), especially Colette's queer companions and her daughter.

This graphic novel shows Colette as powerful and capable. Her early writing was taken by her husband, whom she would soon divorce. This also follows her early years.I would have liked a better introduction to this person, in a better foreword or afterword. I felt a lot of disinterest while I read this because it didn't really help me understand why I should care about this person.

I guess trying to squeeze all her many love affairs makes sense because it’s still a sort of unconventional kind of woman’s life even by today’s quite monogamous standards, but I got lost after the third mustachioed dude in a top-hat, and couldn’t tell the guy she met later in life and invited to the rivera from Missy. Why even, then? I understand that there seemed to be a chronological effort, but we really didn’t need all the repetitive and interchangeable men. Besides, the more important and impactful characters, like Missy, again, got lost in this whole flurry. And so did Colette’s writing career.

This graphic novel does an elegant job of describing the early life and development of the woman who came to take society by storm in the late 1800's and early 1900's. A writer, before women were writers. A performer in the most scandalous of ways, back when women performing at all was a scandal in itself. It describes how as a young woman, her much older husband betrayed her trust repeatedly, both sexually and by taking credit for her writing.All in all an excellent story of it's times, perfectly combined with the lovely artwork, I can't speak for how historically accurate it might be, but it certainly inspires an interest to learn more about the subject.",0,"['2022-reading-challenge', 'comics-graphic-novels']"

Christina,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4822789-christina,3,"June 1, 2019","I came across this biography of Colette in graphic format in a thrift store of all places. The artwork is gorgeous and does well to evoke the early 20th century. I know of Colette, but wasn’t very familiar with her life apart from that she wrote risqué literature that was sometimes autobiographical, and was married to an older man.This biography gives a good quick overview of her life. It’s translated from the French, a fact I suspected as I read the introduction as I’ve found the French style of writing difficult to absorb in other books. I’ve studied all the Romance languages to varying degrees—Spanish for 12 years (middle school through college), Latin for 2 years in high school, Portuguese for a semester in college, and a little Italian through singing. I even touched on Galician Portuguese in a medieval Spanish literature class. As an adult, I’ve tried self-teaching myself some French, but it feels very different from the others, and no matter how I try, it just doesn’t click with me. I had a word-a-day French calendar, and only manage to make my French-speaking coworker break into laughter at my awful pronunciation. Then I tried the Pimsleur audio language course, which walks you through some basic information helpful to tourists, asking where a street is and such, and concludes with inviting a woman up to your hotel room. I had these audio courses in more than one language, and loaned one to a friend who said the other language led to the exact same conversation. I wonder if they all do. But I digress....The main challenge with this book for a reader not familiar with French language and culture is there are a lot of names of people and places. I think for a French reader, these would be familiar, or they could at least absorb them better in the way that even if you aren’t familiar with the Biltmore Estate, you know what the word estate means. Add to this challenge that graphic format tends to have an exceptionally fast pace, often relying on the illustrations to convey a lot of the information. While the artwork was beautiful, as the people followed similar fashions, it was hard to distinguish who was who, and not all the character are clearly introduced. It feels as though this book is for people who are already familiar with Colette’s life.It was still worth reading. I hadn’t realized just how unconventional she was for her time. She grew up in the country, and married a wealthy 34-year-old writer at the age of 20, moving to his apartment. He was known for having many affairs, and the practice didn’t end with his marriage. He encouraged her to write, and published her work under his own name, which at the time she was okay with. Colette came to take female lovers herself. After they divorced, she lived with a woman who dressed and lived as a man, something that it took me a while to realize in this book, due to it relying primarily on illustration and having only one gender pronoun at the end of the relationship, though there were references before that. Colette was also an actress, often appearing partially nude on stage. In addition to novels, she wrote newspaper articles, as well as many letters to her mother, which I imagine is tremendously helpful to biographers. She married again and at 40 gave birth to a daughter who seems to have been largely neglected. She also became lovers with her second husband’s teenage son from a previous marriage, the revelation of which ended her marriage.I haven’t read Colette’s novels. I started one at some point in my twenties, but couldn’t get into it. I might try again. I can’t help wondering if her fame and appeal are largely due to her gift for writing, or her shocking and scandalous content. I imagine it must be both, as I’m sure there are many smutty books that weren’t well written that are now lost in the past. At any rate, I think I might try her first novel, Claudine at School about her girlhood in the French countryside, and possibly continue through the other Claudine novels, or jump to her later work The Ripening Seed.",0,"['biography', 'graphic-format']"
Kend,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6854780-kend,3,"September 17, 2018","I'm always excited to see a good comic book biography flit across my shelves; there are some truly beautiful ones making their way into library collections and onto bookstore shelves at the moment, and The Provocative Colette is part of this ongoing trend. This is perhaps not the strongest example; the language felt a bit stilted, as if the translation's accuracy had been privileged over readability, and the art style is attractive but not quite pushing the envelope. That is, this volume is constrained by the shared challenges facing all illustrated biographies—limited page-space, the difficult balance between text and image, and a need to impress readers on all fronts—and it doesn't really rise above them. The best picture book biographies, in my opinion, use one moment to access a person's larger story ... but Goetzinger tries to cover several decades of Colette's life, which as other reviewers have already pointed out, requires the book to progress at a blistering pace to cover all of the various important events. All this to say, this is an accomplished piece of illustrated nonfiction, but it is not necessarily entertaining.

There was literally speech bubbles that just said ""blah, blah, blah""; and many highlights were just suddenly told like she discovered her 1st husband's mistress and was just sad for a bit but decided to overlook it as long as she could live in the country and write books for him to publish under his name. Then at some point she agrees to have an affair with one of his mistresses, and start acting in burlesque shows. All things that could have been provocative moments but just fell flat because Collette supposedly had little choice in these decisions or even seemed to enjoy them, just doing whatever her ""master"" allowed until she fell for some new lover, all the while supposedly having massive success as an author, screen & stage writer. She didn't seem provocative, more sad & used.But the artwork is divine, definitely transported me to early 1900 Paris and made me want to read Collette's work.",0,"['2023-goodreads-challenge', 'groovy-graphics', 'library-loans']"

I understand that Colette is an icon for reclaiming female sexuality, but this felt more exploitative than celebratory.I actually went into this with a fairly strong dislike of Colette, mostly from my experience reading La Vagabonde (which is partially autobiographical) and absolutely HATING the protagonist. This book certainly didn't make me like her more, but I definitely respect the hell out of her now. I was mostly compelled to finish it because of the side ""characters"" (they were real people, so not sure how to refer to them), especially Colette's queer companions and her daughter.

L'idée de revenir sur cette partie de la vie de Colette (et l'importance de ses relations amoureuses) est intéressante mais sa réalisation me paraît, ici, un peu bancale (les événements éventuellement tragiques sont passés sous silence, tout le monde est beau et heureux, les personnages sont bienveillants, ...). Le dessin de l'autrice, que j'avais découvert dans la BD faite sur Christian Dior, est toujours aussi ""fin"" et élégant.

This comics biography by Annie Goetzinger covers a period in Colette's life she had much written about, La Belle Époque, a period of Western history usually dated from the end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. In Colette's case, the focus is on her marriage at 20 to her divorce. The main thing that happened during this time is that she and her husband had a lot of ""affairs,"" so this book focuses on that. Freedom!? And there's some focus on the writing. Her husband hired people to ghost-write novels for him, but he never had success such as he had when Collette began writing novels for him. The first two sold more than 40,000 copies a piece. It was not until later that she began to own her own work and developed a reputation of her own. I like the lovely, period-seeming art; the story is, amazingly, given the subject matter, less than compelling, unfortunately. One affair blends into the next, you don't get to know them, eh.

"Vicky ""phenkos""",https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10519601-vicky-phenkos,2,"August 12, 2018","I became interested in this comic book/graphic novel because it covers a period in Colette’s life that’s not as well known and documented as her later period – Colette’s formative years during her marriage to Henry Gauthier-Villars and immediately after her divorce. In this younger Colette we find a woman who is “at once wise and unconventional, sweet and vindictive, steadfast and fickle, natural […] and affected”, as Nathalie Crom says in her Introduction. The Introduction aside, however, I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I’d thought I would. For one thing, I didn’t like the drawing very much; the colouring was subdued and uninteresting and the pencilling itself was not as highly accomplished as I’d expected. The other problem was the rendering of the story: it was too fragmentary and quickly paced covering large stretches of Colette’s life without sufficient depth and detail. As a result, the reader had to rely on the introduction to fill in the gaps, thus creating a vicious circle: without the introduction the reader has difficulty following the story, but, having read the introduction, the graphics do not add much to the main story. So overall: the concept was good and had a lot of potential, but unfortunately the implementation left much to be desired. Thanks to Netgalley for the advance copy.",11,[]

Christina,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4822789-christina,3,"June 1, 2019","I came across this biography of Colette in graphic format in a thrift store of all places. The artwork is gorgeous and does well to evoke the early 20th century. I know of Colette, but wasn’t very familiar with her life apart from that she wrote risqué literature that was sometimes autobiographical, and was married to an older man.This biography gives a good quick overview of her life. It’s translated from the French, a fact I suspected as I read the introduction as I’ve found the French style of writing difficult to absorb in other books. I’ve studied all the Romance languages to varying degrees—Spanish for 12 years (middle school through college), Latin for 2 years in high school, Portuguese for a semester in college, and a little Italian through singing. I even touched on Galician Portuguese in a medieval Spanish literature class. As an adult, I’ve tried self-teaching myself some French, but it feels very different from the others, and no matter how I try, it just doesn’t click with me. I had a word-a-day French calendar, and only manage to make my French-speaking coworker break into laughter at my awful pronunciation. Then I tried the Pimsleur audio language course, which walks you through some basic information helpful to tourists, asking where a street is and such, and concludes with inviting a woman up to your hotel room. I had these audio courses in more than one language, and loaned one to a friend who said the other language led to the exact same conversation. I wonder if they all do. But I digress....The main challenge with this book for a reader not familiar with French language and culture is there are a lot of names of people and places. I think for a French reader, these would be familiar, or they could at least absorb them better in the way that even if you aren’t familiar with the Biltmore Estate, you know what the word estate means. Add to this challenge that graphic format tends to have an exceptionally fast pace, often relying on the illustrations to convey a lot of the information. While the artwork was beautiful, as the people followed similar fashions, it was hard to distinguish who was who, and not all the character are clearly introduced. It feels as though this book is for people who are already familiar with Colette’s life.It was still worth reading. I hadn’t realized just how unconventional she was for her time. She grew up in the country, and married a wealthy 34-year-old writer at the age of 20, moving to his apartment. He was known for having many affairs, and the practice didn’t end with his marriage. He encouraged her to write, and published her work under his own name, which at the time she was okay with. Colette came to take female lovers herself. After they divorced, she lived with a woman who dressed and lived as a man, something that it took me a while to realize in this book, due to it relying primarily on illustration and having only one gender pronoun at the end of the relationship, though there were references before that. Colette was also an actress, often appearing partially nude on stage. In addition to novels, she wrote newspaper articles, as well as many letters to her mother, which I imagine is tremendously helpful to biographers. She married again and at 40 gave birth to a daughter who seems to have been largely neglected. She also became lovers with her second husband’s teenage son from a previous marriage, the revelation of which ended her marriage.I haven’t read Colette’s novels. I started one at some point in my twenties, but couldn’t get into it. I might try again. I can’t help wondering if her fame and appeal are largely due to her gift for writing, or her shocking and scandalous content. I imagine it must be both, as I’m sure there are many smutty books that weren’t well written that are now lost in the past. At any rate, I think I might try her first novel, Claudine at School about her girlhood in the French countryside, and possibly continue through the other Claudine novels, or jump to her later work The Ripening Seed.",0,"['biography', 'graphic-format']"

This is perhaps not the strongest example; the language felt a bit stilted, as if the translation's accuracy had been privileged over readability, and the art style is attractive but not quite pushing the envelope. That is, this volume is constrained by the shared challenges facing all illustrated biographies—limited page-space, the difficult balance between text and image, and a need to impress readers on all fronts—and it doesn't really rise above them. The best picture book biographies, in my opinion, use one moment to access a person's larger story ... but Goetzinger tries to cover several decades of Colette's life, which as other reviewers have already pointed out, requires the book to progress at a blistering pace to cover all of the various important events. All this to say, this is an accomplished piece of illustrated nonfiction, but it is not necessarily entertaining.

Then at some point she agrees to have an affair with one of his mistresses, and start acting in burlesque shows. All things that could have been provocative moments but just fell flat because Collette supposedly had little choice in these decisions or even seemed to enjoy them, just doing whatever her ""master"" allowed until she fell for some new lover, all the while supposedly having massive success as an author, screen & stage writer.

The illustration is fine if not remarkable. But the book, as a whole, is somewhat brief and shallow, so while it has some value, I imagine there must be more informative biographies of Colette available.",0,['library-books']
Jennybeast,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153045-jennybeast,4,"December 11, 2018","I'm really enjoying these short biographies by Annie Goetzinger. I like the subject matter (women in France, especially here, a famous female author with an interesting career), I like the beautifully drawn graphic novel, I like her willingness to frankly discuss unusual domestic arrangements that open a door to historical LGBTQ experiences. Solid storytelling, interesting subject.",0,"['biography', 'graphic_novels', 'historical-fiction']"
Lee Ann,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2446412-lee-ann,3,"January 7, 2019","After seeing the movie Colette, I wanted to read Claudine or Gigi (my library, unusually, didn't have either) and learn more about Colette. This was a graphic novel that shared much of what was in the film, but then continued the highlights of her life into old age. Nice overview, enough to whet a reader's appetite for more or leave the more casual reader satisfied.",0,[]
Carly,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19989085-carly,2,"June 13, 2021",CW: racial slur This story was hard to follow. The illustrations were fun and reading about Colette was fascinating but it felt like the flow between panels and pages wasn’t always clear. Sometimes I’d find myself going backwards to figure out what just happened or who these characters were.Combine that with the very unnecessary racial slur and this book wasn’t a winner for me.,0,[]
