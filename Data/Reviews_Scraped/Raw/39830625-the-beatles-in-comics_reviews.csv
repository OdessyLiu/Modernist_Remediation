Julie ,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,4,"December 14, 2018","The Beatles in Comics by by Gaet's, Michels Mabel is a 2018 by NBM Publishing publication. I've listened to The Beatles since I was a very small child. But, it wasn't until I was about ten or eleven that I became an avid fan. I’m not a collector of memorabilia or anything, but I do love reading anything about the group, and have several lovely coffee table books about The Beatles. This book intrigued me because this past year I suddenly developed an interest in Graphic Novels, Manga, and Comics. The Beatles and Comics? How could I pass that up? I was a little surprised when the book arrived in the mail. I wasn’t expecting such a lovely hardcover ‘coffee table’ style book! What a nice surprise! However, the first thing that should be noted is that this book is not entirely made up of comics. In fact, the comics sections divide the space with the standard coffee table book format. The book chronicles the history of the group, from their first interest in music and onwards, using photographs and comics along with some brief remarks or commentary. The other thing a knowledgeable comic lover will notice is that multiple illustrators contributed the artwork for this book. In and of itself, that’s not a problem, at least not for me. However, even a novice like myself couldn’t help but notice the extreme differences in style. Some of the artwork is better than others, which makes the overall experience a little uneven. In one instance, an illustration of a young Paul McCartney reminded me of Eddie Munster. The Beatles were barely recognizable in a few of the other comics drawings, as well. However, for the most part, the various artists did a good job of depicting the Fab Four at various stages in their careers. Beyond the illustrations, the book was typical of a coffee table book, lots of great, glossy photos of the band, along with wonderful bits of history and trivia. I enjoyed looking through the book and I think the book will make a great conversation piece. If you are Beatles fan, you might want to consider this one, for its uniqueness, if for no other reason. This book would also make a nice gift, not only for the die hard Beatles fan, but for those who enjoy history, pop culture and nostalgia. 3.5 stars",67,"['2018', 'comics-manga', 'giveaways']"
Dave,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35045983-dave,4,"November 28, 2018","""The Beatles in Comics"" is a fun coffee table type book telling the history of the Beatles. There are 24 chapters, each beginning with a short summary and photos of that part of their history. That part is similar to many coffee table music books. That summary is then followed by a cartoon story, with each chapter featuring work by a different artist. I found this book to be lots of fun. The advance reader's copy I was provided only took the story fifty percent of the way through - to the Shea Stadium concert. Would like to see the rest someday. Bottom line- just plain old fun.",6,"['music-books', 'read-borrowed']"

Seriously, you do not want me as your co-worker in any sort of drawing at a company gathering.)I have a passing familiarity with the Beatles, but growing up, mine was an Elvis Presley family. I do own a few of the Fab Four's best-of compilations and the White Album though.This is a nice, if not particularly deep, survey of the band's formation, rise in popularity, and break-up. It's jam-packed with photos and comic strips and anecdotes in text and comic form. Fun!Unfortunately, the text pieces and comic strips are written by two different people, and they aren't well coordinated, so they feature a lot - a whole lot - of redundancies. In each chapter the text piece seems to serve the purpose of setting the stage for the strip, but mostly acts as a spoiler of sorts. In almost every chapter, big events and several bits of trivia from the text is simply repeated in the strip. It just doesn't seem like the best use of time or space.A couple dozen artists contribute the strips and spot illustrations. All are decent, though most have a fairly cartoony style as opposed to going for photorealism. Not all are quite able to capture and convey likenesses, so John and Paul (and occasionally George) are sometimes hard to tell apart before John gets his glasses.

There are also short blocks of text and actual photos to move the story along. As with any comics anthology, there will be art styles you will like and those you do not. From funny caricatures to realistic portraits to anime-style, you'll see the Fab Four presented in a lot of different ways. I'll be honest, it felt kind of Deviantart-y. (I was a little weirded out by the comic where Paul had the creepy hollow eyes like something out of ""Spirited Away."")While this book definitely isn't The Fifth Beatle: The Brian Epstein Story or Baby's in Black: Astrid Kirchherr, Stuart Sutcliffe, and The Beatles, it also isn't those cheap and cheesy John/George cash-in comics that came out a few years ago, either.

Denis,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2298109-denis,4,"April 2, 2017","Last summer, here in London (Ontario, Canada - not Her Majesty's London in the UK), organizers tried out something new, simply called, ""Beatle Fest"". They blocked off some of the downtown streets and booked various all sorts of (mostly local) Beatle, McCartney and Lennon tribute bands at various stages and night clubs where they played various Fab Four hits. There were booths set up selling Beatle and sunny peace-loving sixties memorabilia and merchandise - the main point of the event obviously.The music and overall vibe was alright, if not at times a bit cheesy. I did, however, see this lovely volume on one of the tables. It is a 252 page chronology of the story of the Beatles - starting with the Quarrymen all the way to the breakup and solo careers, illustrated by not one but 25 unique artists from all over Europe (one featured per chapter).There is as much straight forward text by French author ""Gaet's"" here as there is illustration.

Unfortunately, it's riddled with inaccuracies and details that a simple Google search would have solved. I started to get suspicious when I noticed that the book referred to a Beatles hit song ""All My Loving"" as ""All I'm Losing."" Was this a translation issue? Perhaps, but surely someone could have proofread it. Anyway, the art is wonderful and of course I'm game for a Beatles book, but it just wasn't the book I wanted it to be. What did I want it to be? An easily accessible but in depth look at the Fab Four that I could recommend to someone who perhaps wanted more history of the Beatles without the full Lewisohn page number commitment.

Suden Käpälä,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68100915-suden-k-p-l,2,"May 28, 2021","When (or if) given the benefit of doubt, this must have been a labour of love. I want to believe that. Still -- and although it came to me at the right moment and took the right amount of time for the correct amount of benefit -- I can't give it a great rating. Sadly.My expanded reading notes:May 23, 2021 - p38 - As a part of my major music reconsumption & reconnection project, started re-listening my handful of Beatles albums. Never really was a huge fan(#), but I hear they're considered good. Seem to be famous, even? Had opportunity to borrow this book, to learn a bit more about them. It's not great -- either the writing and/or the translation leaves something to be desired. But it's diverse and easily digestible.(#: It's the same with the Beats, for me, like it is with novels such as 1984 and Starship Troopers; I want to love them, I feel I need to respect them and appreciate them... but on a fundamental level, I don't, really. And that makes me a bit sad, and -- almost -- ashamed. Almost. And that's a good sign -- it means my organ for self-reflection is operating at peak efficiency. I have a broad yet distinct taste, and not all masterpieces fall within its established parameters. Some masterworks -- and some pulpy or horribly bad things -- do fit squarely within my taste, however. Leave me alone! I don't wanna talk about it!)May 26, 2021 - p168 - The texts with which the comics are interspersed are riddled with syntax and -- even worse! -- logical errors. Many unintelligible jumps in focus, and weirdly drawn or presented conclusions (often w/o any frame of reference provided); so I can't follow the plot. (Must I be a Beats scholar already? Is that a prerequisite for reading this?) The narrative of the comics is also muddled -- and they're often way too short to make much sense. As a collection of 'fun facts', and as an effort to collect it all in an original way, this earns 2* -- but for sheer annoyance in the other fields, I fear it won't earn any additional ones. The artwork is rather OK.May 27, 2021 - p186 - Funny at times, the editor/author may have attempted also to be lyrical or poetic -- but too much gets lost in translation; or, it was simply a badly executed job.It is a quick read, though. And just about satisfying enough to keep going, in-between at least 4(!) other items being currently read. So, even though I loathe rushed or unpolished publications, I won't lower my intermediate score any further. I think the intentions were good (i.e., heart in the right place).May 27, 2021 - p208 - An H.P. Lovecraft reference on this page: ""Tekeli!"". (Edit: I stand corrected; it seems to be a Poe reference after all, who nicked it from the Beatles before HPL used it.) Normally, this has a high chance of adding an automatic +1*; like a submarine. (Submarines aplenty in this book, still to come##; but no joy for *s.) What does this mean? Does HPL feature in any Beatles song (or cover artwork)? Or is it one of the myriad weird phrases that the author dropped in and never elaborates upon? That happens 5x on every page, leaving me wondering what I missed this time. The book as a whole I feel is extremely esoteric, but for knowledgable people it can't contain anything of added value... So, what audience does it strive to service, exactly?(##: Regretfully, too little is written in this comics anthology about the Yellow Sub. As if to antagonize me -- but my mind was already made up about 2*, so I'll not subtract the second * for that blatant omission of the colourful submerisible, about which I was the most curious.)Conclusion: So, while it was nice and entertaining, and even mildly educational, this wasn't for me. I'm not sure whom it is for. The two people I know who are bigger Beats fans than I am, didn't seem to care for it all that much, either. But obviously, it has its share of followers, and I'm glad for that.",0,"['rated-2-mediocre-barely-my-taste', 'read-comics']"

Conjunto en algunos cortos y otros tantos eternos capítulos, cuenta la historia de cómo nació esa banda pop tan trascendental (para algunos) de 1960. Desde el primer momento en que Paul versión fetus se topa con John Lennon en un concierto al aire libre que lo deja impresionado. Uno de los momentos más especiales de la banda.La historia está ""narrada"" de una manera muy peculiar y original, por medio de cómics y también texto. Sobretodo es muy informativa, por lo que, si deseas conocer al grupo con más profundidad, es una lectura perfecta. He llegado a saber mucho más de su historia y mi parte favorita de todo, sobre su música. En algunos capítulos se centran en canciones o álbumes, y si escuchas dicha canción a la vez que lees su historia, la experiencia se hace mucho más especial.No sólo se centra el libro en los Beatles sino también en las personas y estilos musicales que los influyeron. Así mismo se encuentran documentados lugares y fechas, y todas las personas que pusieron su granito de arena para crear la increíble banda que fueron en '60-'70.Aun así, tengo que admitir que algunos capítulos de la historia me parecieron aburridos y complicados. No sé si será por el idioma en el que lo leí, pero a veces simplemente me saltaba tanto texto y leía su resumen por medio del cómic al final. Eso también lo puede hacer repetitivo: que el cómic es simplemente una manera más rápida de leer la historia entera.En contradicción a todo lo dicho anteriormente, no puedo evitar darle sus 5 estrellas.

Brittany,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"October 2, 2019","How I Came to Read This Book: A random pick-up at the library.The Plot: The Beatles story is told in about two dozen different comic chapters, interspersed with contextual historical background before each graphic novel portion (and some random asides, like lyrics and weird fun facts told at the end). Each comic is crafted by a different artist who all give the group very different visual treatments. Everything from the Quarrymen to touring in America to Yoko Ono are covered here - including life after the band broke up. The Good & The Bad: I have no real feelings about this book either way, so three stars it gets. It's a breezy skate through various key chapters of The Beatles' careers, some more relevant than others (the 'Paul is Dead' section, while amusing and something I'd never heard of before, didn't really seem as critical in the grand Beatles' lore). There were certainly some artistic interpretations I enjoyed reading more than others, but in general the comics were pretty coherent and interesting. At times they overlapped a bit too much with the introductory chapters, to the point where I often skim read or only read part of the contextual intros, so as not to ""spoil"" the comic bits. I'm not sure what complaints people would really have - I'm just kind of indifferent! This was an enjoyable enough fly over of the history of the greatest band of all time.The Bottom Line: A creative if not wholly complete tribute to The Beatles. It may not be satisfying for the diehards out there, but I enjoyed it. Anything Memorable?: Lots of crazy facts picked up along the way. The Beatles were the first band to ever play stadiums in the U.S. They refused to get back together for a charity reunion concert for $230M. 2019 Book Challenge?: Book #41 in 2019.",0,"['graphic-novel', 'music', 'nonfiction']"
Christine,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82569260-christine,2,"December 12, 2018","This is a comic book that is a nonfictional account of the Beatles forming and rising to fame. It begins with how John, Paul, and George meet and, along with some other friends, begin the Beatles. It shows how they develop as a band, their popularity (Beatlemania), and ends with their Shea Stadium concert.Some good points about this book are how it sticks to nonfiction and does it in a linear way in a graphic novel format. I think that is an interesting way to get that information across to younger audiences. However, I found many distracting qualities in this book that prevented me from really liking or enjoying it. This graphic novel is an apparent collaboration of various authors and perhaps various writers. At some points it reads just like a memoir with actual photographs and then goes off into illustrations recreating events or. conversations. Sometimes the story will leave off on one point, only to have it picked up and reiterated on the next page, which made it feel that it lacked editing. Also, I found it distracting to have several illustrators with different style thoroughly the book. Sometimes you can’t quite recognize the characters of the Beatles. I am a big fan of the Beatles and have read books about the band in the past so I was going into this book intrigued by the idea of a Beatles comic book, but I was disappointed.Thank you Netgalley for my complimentary copy in return for my honest opinion.",0,"['2018', 'biographies', 'graphic-novel']"
Stephanie Bange,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11703149-stephanie-bange,4,"March 25, 2022","An intriguingly formatted biography...This history of The Beatles, from their roots to their post band activities, is divided into 23 short chapters, with information told twice in each chapter. First it is delivered as text with primary source materials such as photographs and song lyrics that highlight key point in the band's evolution. The same information is then shown in graphic form, usually as an incident or series of incidents that give details and insight into that same time period. Text is clear and straightforward information, with little commentary or opinions regarding the actions of the members of the band. Each chapter of graphic information was created by a different graphic artist, so styles range widely. In some chapters, members of the band are easily identified, others take a bit more time to determine who is who. At first, this method of delivering the same information twice confused this reader. Why deliver the same info twice? Why not include other incidents? Why not interweave the two? The text is solid enough to stand on its own for short reports for students. The graphic portion cannot stand alone to be read.Beatles fans will love this book. Useful for simple high school reports, but with the advisory that this does include use of drugs by band members because it influenced their musical path.

It's jam-packed with photos and comic strips and anecdotes in text and comic form. Fun!Unfortunately, the text pieces and comic strips are written by two different people, and they aren't well coordinated, so they feature a lot - a whole lot - of redundancies. In each chapter the text piece seems to serve the purpose of setting the stage for the strip, but mostly acts as a spoiler of sorts. In almost every chapter, big events and several bits of trivia from the text is simply repeated in the strip. It just doesn't seem like the best use of time or space.A couple dozen artists contribute the strips and spot illustrations. All are decent, though most have a fairly cartoony style as opposed to going for photorealism. Not all are quite able to capture and convey likenesses, so John and Paul (and occasionally George) are sometimes hard to tell apart before John gets his glasses. (Thank goodness for Ringo's nose, I guess.)",5,['giveaway']

There are also short blocks of text and actual photos to move the story along. As with any comics anthology, there will be art styles you will like and those you do not.

There were booths set up selling Beatle and sunny peace-loving sixties memorabilia and merchandise - the main point of the event obviously.The music and overall vibe was alright, if not at times a bit cheesy.

Still -- and although it came to me at the right moment and took the right amount of time for the correct amount of benefit -- I can't give it a great rating. Sadly.My expanded reading notes:May 23, 2021 - p38 - As a part of my major music reconsumption & reconnection project, started re-listening my handful of Beatles albums. Never really was a huge fan(#), but I hear they're considered good. Seem to be famous, even? Had opportunity to borrow this book, to learn a bit more about them. It's not great -- either the writing and/or the translation leaves something to be desired. But it's diverse and easily digestible.(#: It's the same with the Beats, for me, like it is with novels such as 1984 and Starship Troopers; I want to love them, I feel I need to respect them and appreciate them... but on a fundamental level, I don't, really. And that makes me a bit sad, and -- almost -- ashamed. Almost. And that's a good sign -- it means my organ for self-reflection is operating at peak efficiency. I have a broad yet distinct taste, and not all masterpieces fall within its established parameters. Some masterworks -- and some pulpy or horribly bad things -- do fit squarely within my taste, however. Leave me alone! I don't wanna talk about it!)May 26, 2021 - p168 - The texts with which the comics are interspersed are riddled with syntax and -- even worse! -- logical errors. Many unintelligible jumps in focus, and weirdly drawn or presented conclusions (often w/o any frame of reference provided); so I can't follow the plot. (Must I be a Beats scholar already? Is that a prerequisite for reading this?) The narrative of the comics is also muddled -- and they're often way too short to make much sense. As a collection of 'fun facts', and as an effort to collect it all in an original way, this earns 2* -- but for sheer annoyance in the other fields, I fear it won't earn any additional ones. The artwork is rather OK.May 27, 2021 - p186 - Funny at times, the editor/author may have attempted also to be lyrical or poetic -- but too much gets lost in translation; or, it was simply a badly executed job.It is a quick read, though. And just about satisfying enough to keep going, in-between at least 4(!) other items being currently read. So, even though I loathe rushed or unpolished publications, I won't lower my intermediate score any further. I think the intentions were good (i.e., heart in the right place).May 27, 2021 - p208 - An H.P. Lovecraft reference on this page: ""Tekeli!"". (Edit: I stand corrected; it seems to be a Poe reference after all, who nicked it from the Beatles before HPL used it.) Normally, this has a high chance of adding an automatic +1*; like a submarine. (Submarines aplenty in this book, still to come##; but no joy for *s.) What does this mean? Does HPL feature in any Beatles song (or cover artwork)? Or is it one of the myriad weird phrases that the author dropped in and never elaborates upon? That happens 5x on every page, leaving me wondering what I missed this time. The book as a whole I feel is extremely esoteric, but for knowledgable people it can't contain anything of added value... So, what audience does it strive to service, exactly?(##: Regretfully, too little is written in this comics anthology about the Yellow Sub. As if to antagonize me -- but my mind was already made up about 2*, so I'll not subtract the second * for that blatant omission of the colourful submerisible, about which I was the most curious.)Conclusion: So, while it was nice and entertaining, and even mildly educational, this wasn't for me. I'm not sure whom it is for. The two people I know who are bigger Beats fans than I am, didn't seem to care for it all that much, either. But obviously, it has its share of followers, and I'm glad for that.",0,"['rated-2-mediocre-barely-my-taste', 'read-comics']"

Brittany,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"October 2, 2019","How I Came to Read This Book: A random pick-up at the library.The Plot: The Beatles story is told in about two dozen different comic chapters, interspersed with contextual historical background before each graphic novel portion (and some random asides, like lyrics and weird fun facts told at the end). Each comic is crafted by a different artist who all give the group very different visual treatments. Everything from the Quarrymen to touring in America to Yoko Ono are covered here - including life after the band broke up. The Good & The Bad: I have no real feelings about this book either way, so three stars it gets. It's a breezy skate through various key chapters of The Beatles' careers, some more relevant than others (the 'Paul is Dead' section, while amusing and something I'd never heard of before, didn't really seem as critical in the grand Beatles' lore). There were certainly some artistic interpretations I enjoyed reading more than others, but in general the comics were pretty coherent and interesting. At times they overlapped a bit too much with the introductory chapters, to the point where I often skim read or only read part of the contextual intros, so as not to ""spoil"" the comic bits. I'm not sure what complaints people would really have - I'm just kind of indifferent! This was an enjoyable enough fly over of the history of the greatest band of all time.The Bottom Line: A creative if not wholly complete tribute to The Beatles. It may not be satisfying for the diehards out there, but I enjoyed it. Anything Memorable?: Lots of crazy facts picked up along the way. The Beatles were the first band to ever play stadiums in the U.S. They refused to get back together for a charity reunion concert for $230M. 2019 Book Challenge?: Book #41 in 2019.",0,"['graphic-novel', 'music', 'nonfiction']"
Christine,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82569260-christine,2,"December 12, 2018","This is a comic book that is a nonfictional account of the Beatles forming and rising to fame. It begins with how John, Paul, and George meet and, along with some other friends, begin the Beatles. It shows how they develop as a band, their popularity (Beatlemania), and ends with their Shea Stadium concert.Some good points about this book are how it sticks to nonfiction and does it in a linear way in a graphic novel format. I think that is an interesting way to get that information across to younger audiences. However, I found many distracting qualities in this book that prevented me from really liking or enjoying it. This graphic novel is an apparent collaboration of various authors and perhaps various writers. At some points it reads just like a memoir with actual photographs and then goes off into illustrations recreating events or. conversations. Sometimes the story will leave off on one point, only to have it picked up and reiterated on the next page, which made it feel that it lacked editing. Also, I found it distracting to have several illustrators with different style thoroughly the book. Sometimes you can’t quite recognize the characters of the Beatles. I am a big fan of the Beatles and have read books about the band in the past so I was going into this book intrigued by the idea of a Beatles comic book, but I was disappointed.Thank you Netgalley for my complimentary copy in return for my honest opinion.",0,"['2018', 'biographies', 'graphic-novel']"

First it is delivered as text with primary source materials such as photographs and song lyrics that highlight key point in the band's evolution. The same information is then shown in graphic form, usually as an incident or series of incidents that give details and insight into that same time period. Text is clear and straightforward information, with little commentary or opinions regarding the actions of the members of the band. Each chapter of graphic information was created by a different graphic artist, so styles range widely. In some chapters, members of the band are easily identified, others take a bit more time to determine who is who. At first, this method of delivering the same information twice confused this reader. Why deliver the same info twice? Why not include other incidents? Why not interweave the two? The text is solid enough to stand on its own for short reports for students. The graphic portion cannot stand alone to be read.Beatles fans will love this book.

Julie ,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,4,"December 14, 2018","The Beatles in Comics by by Gaet's, Michels Mabel is a 2018 by NBM Publishing publication. I've listened to The Beatles since I was a very small child. But, it wasn't until I was about ten or eleven that I became an avid fan. I’m not a collector of memorabilia or anything, but I do love reading anything about the group, and have several lovely coffee table books about The Beatles. This book intrigued me because this past year I suddenly developed an interest in Graphic Novels, Manga, and Comics. The Beatles and Comics? How could I pass that up? I was a little surprised when the book arrived in the mail. I wasn’t expecting such a lovely hardcover ‘coffee table’ style book! What a nice surprise! However, the first thing that should be noted is that this book is not entirely made up of comics. In fact, the comics sections divide the space with the standard coffee table book format. The book chronicles the history of the group, from their first interest in music and onwards, using photographs and comics along with some brief remarks or commentary. The other thing a knowledgeable comic lover will notice is that multiple illustrators contributed the artwork for this book. In and of itself, that’s not a problem, at least not for me. However, even a novice like myself couldn’t help but notice the extreme differences in style. Some of the artwork is better than others, which makes the overall experience a little uneven. In one instance, an illustration of a young Paul McCartney reminded me of Eddie Munster. The Beatles were barely recognizable in a few of the other comics drawings, as well. However, for the most part, the various artists did a good job of depicting the Fab Four at various stages in their careers. Beyond the illustrations, the book was typical of a coffee table book, lots of great, glossy photos of the band, along with wonderful bits of history and trivia. I enjoyed looking through the book and I think the book will make a great conversation piece. If you are Beatles fan, you might want to consider this one, for its uniqueness, if for no other reason. This book would also make a nice gift, not only for the die hard Beatles fan, but for those who enjoy history, pop culture and nostalgia. 3.5 stars",67,"['2018', 'comics-manga', 'giveaways']"

There are 24 chapters, each beginning with a short summary and photos of that part of their history. That part is similar to many coffee table music books. That summary is then followed by a cartoon story, with each chapter featuring work by a different artist. I found this book to be lots of fun.

Seriously, you do not want me as your co-worker in any sort of drawing at a company gathering.)I have a passing familiarity with the Beatles, but growing up, mine was an Elvis Presley family. I do own a few of the Fab Four's best-of compilations and the White Album though.This is a nice, if not particularly deep, survey of the band's formation, rise in popularity, and break-up. It's jam-packed with photos and comic strips and anecdotes in text and comic form. Fun!Unfortunately, the text pieces and comic strips are written by two different people, and they aren't well coordinated, so they feature a lot - a whole lot - of redundancies. In each chapter the text piece seems to serve the purpose of setting the stage for the strip, but mostly acts as a spoiler of sorts. In almost every chapter, big events and several bits of trivia from the text is simply repeated in the strip. It just doesn't seem like the best use of time or space.A couple dozen artists contribute the strips and spot illustrations. All are decent, though most have a fairly cartoony style as opposed to going for photorealism. Not all are quite able to capture and convey likenesses, so John and Paul (and occasionally George) are sometimes hard to tell apart before John gets his glasses.

There are also short blocks of text and actual photos to move the story along. As with any comics anthology, there will be art styles you will like and those you do not.

Still -- and although it came to me at the right moment and took the right amount of time for the correct amount of benefit -- I can't give it a great rating. Sadly.My expanded reading notes:May 23, 2021 - p38 - As a part of my major music reconsumption & reconnection project, started re-listening my handful of Beatles albums. Never really was a huge fan(#), but I hear they're considered good. Seem to be famous, even? Had opportunity to borrow this book, to learn a bit more about them. It's not great -- either the writing and/or the translation leaves something to be desired. But it's diverse and easily digestible.(#: It's the same with the Beats, for me, like it is with novels such as 1984 and Starship Troopers; I want to love them, I feel I need to respect them and appreciate them... but on a fundamental level, I don't, really. And that makes me a bit sad, and -- almost -- ashamed. Almost. And that's a good sign -- it means my organ for self-reflection is operating at peak efficiency. I have a broad yet distinct taste, and not all masterpieces fall within its established parameters. Some masterworks -- and some pulpy or horribly bad things -- do fit squarely within my taste, however. Leave me alone! I don't wanna talk about it!)May 26, 2021 - p168 - The texts with which the comics are interspersed are riddled with syntax and -- even worse! -- logical errors. Many unintelligible jumps in focus, and weirdly drawn or presented conclusions (often w/o any frame of reference provided); so I can't follow the plot. (Must I be a Beats scholar already? Is that a prerequisite for reading this?) The narrative of the comics is also muddled -- and they're often way too short to make much sense. As a collection of 'fun facts', and as an effort to collect it all in an original way, this earns 2* -- but for sheer annoyance in the other fields, I fear it won't earn any additional ones. The artwork is rather OK.May 27, 2021 - p186 - Funny at times, the editor/author may have attempted also to be lyrical or poetic -- but too much gets lost in translation; or, it was simply a badly executed job.It is a quick read, though. And just about satisfying enough to keep going, in-between at least 4(!) other items being currently read. So, even though I loathe rushed or unpolished publications, I won't lower my intermediate score any further. I think the intentions were good (i.e., heart in the right place).May 27, 2021 - p208 - An H.P. Lovecraft reference on this page: ""Tekeli!"". (Edit: I stand corrected; it seems to be a Poe reference after all, who nicked it from the Beatles before HPL used it.) Normally, this has a high chance of adding an automatic +1*; like a submarine. (Submarines aplenty in this book, still to come##; but no joy for *s.) What does this mean? Does HPL feature in any Beatles song (or cover artwork)? Or is it one of the myriad weird phrases that the author dropped in and never elaborates upon? That happens 5x on every page, leaving me wondering what I missed this time. The book as a whole I feel is extremely esoteric, but for knowledgable people it can't contain anything of added value... So, what audience does it strive to service, exactly?(##: Regretfully, too little is written in this comics anthology about the Yellow Sub. As if to antagonize me -- but my mind was already made up about 2*, so I'll not subtract the second * for that blatant omission of the colourful submerisible, about which I was the most curious.)Conclusion: So, while it was nice and entertaining, and even mildly educational, this wasn't for me. I'm not sure whom it is for. The two people I know who are bigger Beats fans than I am, didn't seem to care for it all that much, either. But obviously, it has its share of followers, and I'm glad for that.",0,"['rated-2-mediocre-barely-my-taste', 'read-comics']"

Each comic is crafted by a different artist who all give the group very different visual treatments. Everything from the Quarrymen to touring in America to Yoko Ono are covered here - including life after the band broke up. The Good & The Bad: I have no real feelings about this book either way, so three stars it gets. It's a breezy skate through various key chapters of The Beatles' careers, some more relevant than others (the 'Paul is Dead' section, while amusing and something I'd never heard of before, didn't really seem as critical in the grand Beatles' lore). There were certainly some artistic interpretations I enjoyed reading more than others, but in general the comics were pretty coherent and interesting. At times they overlapped a bit too much with the introductory chapters, to the point where I often skim read or only read part of the contextual intros, so as not to ""spoil"" the comic bits. I'm not sure what complaints people would really have - I'm just kind of indifferent! This was an enjoyable enough fly over of the history of the greatest band of all time.The Bottom Line: A creative if not wholly complete tribute to The Beatles. It may not be satisfying for the diehards out there, but I enjoyed it. Anything Memorable?: Lots of crazy facts picked up along the way.

It begins with how John, Paul, and George meet and, along with some other friends, begin the Beatles. It shows how they develop as a band, their popularity (Beatlemania), and ends with their Shea Stadium concert.Some good points about this book are how it sticks to nonfiction and does it in a linear way in a graphic novel format. I think that is an interesting way to get that information across to younger audiences. However, I found many distracting qualities in this book that prevented me from really liking or enjoying it. This graphic novel is an apparent collaboration of various authors and perhaps various writers. At some points it reads just like a memoir with actual photographs and then goes off into illustrations recreating events or. conversations. Sometimes the story will leave off on one point, only to have it picked up and reiterated on the next page, which made it feel that it lacked editing. Also, I found it distracting to have several illustrators with different style thoroughly the book. Sometimes you can’t quite recognize the characters of the Beatles.

First it is delivered as text with primary source materials such as photographs and song lyrics that highlight key point in the band's evolution. The same information is then shown in graphic form, usually as an incident or series of incidents that give details and insight into that same time period. Text is clear and straightforward information, with little commentary or opinions regarding the actions of the members of the band. Each chapter of graphic information was created by a different graphic artist, so styles range widely. In some chapters, members of the band are easily identified, others take a bit more time to determine who is who. At first, this method of delivering the same information twice confused this reader. Why deliver the same info twice? Why not include other incidents? Why not interweave the two? The text is solid enough to stand on its own for short reports for students.

De plus, le ton dans les texte est trop familier, avec un un jangage français avec jargon.Bref, selon moi c'est navrant.",0,[]
Rigoberto Vega,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66207721-rigoberto-vega,4,"May 5, 2020","I felt like I was reading and seeing a detailed timeline of the life and career of the Beatles. Each chapter does a great job giving you a short summary of what was taking place at the time with photographs and some writing before each comic section. One of the things I disliked was the lack of psychedelic imagery because the Beatles were so involved in 60's drug culture, that it feels like a big missed opportunity for the artist involved. Still, I liked the graphic novel regardless of the minor nuisances here and there.",2,['graphic-novels']
Maria Rowe,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23376453-maria-rowe,2,"May 11, 2020","I enjoyed the variety of illustrators but the book was very disjointed. Each chapter consists of a few pages of writing, then a comic. But the writing and comic just repeat each other. It was really repetitive, and I started to skip the written pages and just read the comics.Really needed some editing. Plus, there were some errors in it such as saying there was just a few years in between McCartney getting the MBE and being knighted: that was actually several decades.The illustrations overall ranged from great to ok (a few of the comics I couldn’t tell who was who).",0,"['beatles', 'comics', 'music']"

First, this book is worth just for the photos alone, the artwork in addition to that is just damn amazing. There is literally no such thing as too much Beatles, it was fun to rehash the facts I knew and learned a couple of new things as well... I truly enjoyed it, especially the tickets at the end, classic and fun. It truly makes me wish that i’d been alive for it! Incredibly fun read.",0,[]
Brendan,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17682356-brendan,4,"March 5, 2020","This was a fun little book with chapters about stages in the life of the Beatles interspersed with some panels depicting an event from that time. There’s some fun facts in here even for someone like me who already knows a lot about the band. Some of the artists are more interesting than others, and the comic panels are where the real draw is in this book. Still, one I’d recommend to Beatles fans as it’s a unique take on the history of the band.",0,[]

The errors don't necessarily detract from one's pleasure when reading this! It is a fast read, like a movie. It is nice to relax with some pictures once in a while, rather than the huge volumes Beatles fans are usually working their way through.
