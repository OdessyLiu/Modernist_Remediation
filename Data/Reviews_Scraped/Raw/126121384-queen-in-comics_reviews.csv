Rod Brown,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23954351-rod-brown,3,"July 24, 2023","I'm not a big fan of the format of the ""Pop Rock in Comics"" series -- short comic strips of five pages by 17 different illustrators of key moments, each followed by a text piece that rehashes and slightly expands on the strip -- but I keep checking the books out of the library because they always appeal to my nostalgia by covering the history of the bands and singers I grew up listening to.This is a nice overview of Queen that, like the recent biopic, focuses heavily on lead singer Freddie Mercury. It's not deep, and the artists vary wildly in styles and the ability to capture likenesses of the real people involved, but it gets you in the mood to put on a Queen playlist or check out some old videos.",4,[]

MKF,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14072411-mkf,2,"July 3, 2023",So the cover drew my attention and I wished the creators of this book used that artist for the whole book. Instead each section has a different artist and many of them were terrible and ruined the book for me. Nothing like seeing such amazing artist drawn in such terrible ways especially the childish and cartoonish and not a good cartoon.This is why I prefered the history parts at the end of each of the sections insted of the comics. Still worth reading if you're a Queen fan but know that there is another comic about Freddie that is a bit better.,0,['music-and-musicians']
Jennifer Ingle,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91542602-jennifer-ingle,4,"June 20, 2023","This was a fun and interesting read about the band Queen. The chapters are organized in chronological order, basically focusing on one album release at a time. Each one is authored by a different artist, so it’s particularly interesting to see the varied depictions of the bandmates. Along with each comic, there’s a two-page spread of text and photos providing more information on that moment in time. I learned a lot about Queen and come away from this book in awe of their musical genius.",0,[]

Kyla,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5867457-kyla,2,"August 7, 2023","As a Queen fan, I was eager to dig into this pastiche biography. The artwork is lovely, with each artist’s style highlighting a different part of the band’s history. However, the un-illustrated portions are poor in quality. Whether this is an issue of translation or of editing is unclear. What is clear is that I found the bad writing and font choice (which kind of “hides” certain punctuation marks) to be so off-putting that I nearly abandoned reading the book more than once. If you choose to read this book, stick to the illustrated portions.",0,[]
tony dillard jr,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42161646-tony-dillard-jr,4,"July 20, 2024","Queen in Comics is a bit of a misnomer. From the title, I thought it was going to be an anthology of various times where the Freddie Mercury fronted band appeared in comic books and graphic novels. In reality, the book is split into 2 parts that alternate from sequential art form vignettes of the 50 year plus history of the band along with long form articles that dig deeper into the history of Queen as seen by a variety of artists.Originally published in French in 2021, the comic segments were written by Emmanuel Marie. The text of the articles were by Sophie Blitman. I counted at least 18 different artists, presumably all French. None of the contributors are names I'm familiar with. A long time fan of Queen, I've seen several documentaries about the band. I have both Greatest Hits, Volume 1 and 2 memorized. Experienced their set at Live Aid, live from my cousin's house. I read a biography about Mercury and I saw Bohemian Rhapsody- in the theaters twice. So I have a fairly good knowledge of their history. Yet, I found myself learning some new facts and anecdotes about the group. Things like the near homicidal collaboration between Queen and David Bowie on what would become one of my all-time favorite songs, Under Pressure. I learned about Michael Jackson's influence on releasing Another One Bites the Dust into becoming Queen's best selling single in the US, as well as how Jacko's llama nearly scared Freddie to death during a recording session. Plus there was a lot of details on the solo careers of Brian May and Roger Taylor; two members of the quartet who often get overlooked despite still being the only original members of the band remaining and rocking to this day.Learning some new facts about one of my favorite bands is not to say that some important segments of Queen's history weren't glossed over. Nowhere is there any mention of Queen's involvement in the 1980 Flash Gordon movie that bombed big time but has grown into a cult favorite. A lot is also made of Freddie's dying wish to spend his remaining days recording music with his mates. But important songs from this era like I'm Going Slightly Mad and Mother Love are omitted. Speaking of the dying wish of Freddie Mercury, in 1987, the singer was diagnosed with HIV which soon developed into AIDS. Just about every previous resource I have consumed on the history of Queen discusses Mercury's homosexuality and probable causes of where and how he may have contracted the disease. While Freddie being gay is mentioned as is his final relationship with hairdresser Jim Hutton covered, I felt like Queen in Comics decided that discretion was the better part of valor when it comes to the many excesses of Freddie Mercury. Publisher NBM Graphic Novels has several other music graphic novels in their coffers. Rock history lessons on Bowie, The Beatles and Michael Jackson have peaked my interest and I would not be opposed to reading and possibly owning those volumes in the future.A really interesting read that changes narrative perspectives as well as art forms frequently, just like Queen. A bit of glam rock, some punk and bits of jazz and opera. Queen in Comics doesn't paint a complete picture of the band. But it does manage to capture the ever changing musical and cultural influences of these rock legends quite nicely.",0,[]
MK,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61667429-mk,4,"September 5, 2023","I didn't realize that today was Freddie Mercury's birthday when I finally picked it up and stayed up late to read it. The book is divided into sections, with a different artist taking on each one. The first few styles aren't that different so I didn't even realize at first. It was nice that as the book went on there was a unity as there wasn't a style that was wildly different unlike other books in the series, but enough to make it interesting.The book focuses mostly on Freddie, which shouldn't be a surprise but I would have like to have seen a little more of the childhoods of the other members. It's a small quibble though, as it hits all the important moments in the evolution of the band and at the end of each section the deeper dive we get on the section was very informative. One talked about Roger Taylor's solo career, which I had no idea of.In all, a wonderful look at one of the most seminal bands in rock. Great primer for anyone who wants to know more about the band.",0,[]
Alicia,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia,3,"July 5, 2024","I read Prince's biography first and after reading Queen's now too, I realize the one thing I dislike about them is the back and forth between comics and prose. I want one or the other but not both. It disrupts the flow rather than punctuating certain elements that I think is what it attempts to do. In addition, having multiple illustrators for the graphic chapters is just as distracting. Either way, learning about Freddie Mercury and the impetus of the band Queen and their ascension to pop stars across the world leaving behind some of the most enduring sports songs (Champions, Rock You) and Mercury's vocal range, or their choices for their record covers, and how he kept his HIV status a secret until he couldn't any more is all worthwhile of exploration. It's the format in which it's done that I'm not the biggest fan of. I learned something and that's more of what matters.",0,"['adult', 'artsy', 'asian']"
Kindle Addict,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139003132-kindle-addict,3,"April 28, 2024","An interesting read about a band I love but I wish the whole book has been done in the same style as the cover. The cover is gorgeous and I expected the same artist to draw the graphic novel part but it’s actually chapters done by a new artist each time.The organisation was also a bit strange in my opinion: for each part you get the graphic novel bit, followed by 2/3 pages of text that go over the same time period you just read (with some additional details.) Sometimes the back and forth on the timeline was a bit confusing and other times this choice made for too much repetition.Overall a nice way to learn more about the band and to get to hear some fun stories…",0,[]

Freddie Mercury is a legend.",0,[]
Peacegal,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3078602-peacegal,4,"June 28, 2023","The one-of-a-kind rock band is profiled in this fun and informational graphic biography. Each section, representing a different phase in the life of Freddie Mercury and the band, is done by a different comics artist, representing a wild variety of styles. Thankfully, text sections are included for more in-depth profiles of Queen's bombastic career, so the expositional dialogue doesn't get too over the top, which is a common pitfall in many graphic biographies.",0,[]
Raven Black,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33499064-raven-black,4,"May 4, 2023","Different artistic/author hit on the highlights of the journey of Queen. Focusing on the good and the bad, a realistic timeline is created. The different styles of art sometimes are a little ""off putting"" but also is an interesting way of presenting. In between the chapters there is a factual recap, more information and even photographs of what was happening, people and places mentioned.",0,[]
Ryan Miller,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/206273-ryan-miller,3,"June 20, 2023","This may not be enough for hard-core Queen fans, but for those (like me) that like their music and am intrigued by stories of musicians, it’s an entertaining read. Combining spreads of expositioanary text with short comics that retell times, this seems to be a decent overview of Queen’s history. Both the text and the comics were serviceable, if not special.",0,[]
Blane,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4914956-blane,2,"June 30, 2023","Superficial graphic approach to the history of Queen.
