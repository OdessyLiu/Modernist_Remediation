Dave Schaafsma,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma,4,"August 16, 2017","Thoreau: A Sublime Life is a short, evocative comics biography by French team, writer Maximilien Roy and A. Dan (Daniel Alexandre). It’s not a mere chronological biography—it’s too short for that—but even it were twice the length they wouldn't have been interested in that. What they want to do is create a comics portrait of Thoreau through images and ideas, snapshots more than film, poetic images more than an in-depth philosophical biography. It’s their image of Thoreau. I know Thoreau’s work, or did, and I bet most of you are familiar with him and can say a few things about him. Walden, “On Civil Disobedience.” I have a picture book of him called Henry (in part because I have a son, Henry) that I like, too.This bio of Thoreau features some quotations from him with which I was unfamiliar. For instance, Thoreau taught for a short time in the Concord School. He hated the regimentation, the required discipline, so he schooled kids in his home, with his brother: “We came up with new approaches to education, outings in nature, more active participation with students, no more corporal punishment.” I’d like to know more about his approach, but we only get this glimpse. But you can build a whole educational philosophy based on that glimpse!“I just want everyone to explore their own path.”And on the environment and man’s historical ignorant rapacious use of it: “If a man walks in the woods for love of them, for half the day, he is in danger of being a loafer; but if he spends his whole day as a speculator, shearing off those woods, and making the earth bald before her time, he is esteemed an industrious and enterprising citizen.”“Wanting to be famous means wanting to be contaminated.”He read as deeply into Buddhism and Hinduism as Christianity. “The Brahmins understood that possessions end up possessing us.”Thoreau was more spiritual than political, in general, though he was adamantaly opposed to slavery, he hated the US-Mexican War, and he wouldn’t pay taxes to a government that thrived from such activities. He was also an anarchist of sorts, who preferred the road less travelled and improvisation to authoritarian structures. He was an ecologist, and environmentalist, and we need him again, as always.Michael Granger’s short essay on Thoreau completes the book, which I liked very much. The art from A. Dan, who studied biology and ecology, is great.",33,"['environment', 'gn-bio', 'philosophy']"
George Ilsley,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4003368-george-ilsley,3,"December 14, 2022","First, this was originally produced in French. It's interesting how many biographical graphic novels are produced in Europe about cultural figures in the U.S. — and they do such a good job of it.Thoreau is a writer who is often romanticized, and this book does not avoid that tendency. The essay at the end, by Professor Michel Granger, provides more insight and background. The famous cabin on Walden's Pond, for instance, is usually described as ""secluded"" but was only a few miles from the family home—the essay does mention that, but when Thoreau is portrayed as living a life of freedom and independence at his cabin, it goes unsaid that his mother and sisters were delivering meals and doing his laundry. So much for living outside the structures of society.Thoreau remains a huge influence for his idealistic approach to nature and living in freedom and splendid isolation. Romanticizing such a writer, one who never really left his parents' home but is held up as a model of independence, gets on my nerves.The best part of this book is the essay at the end.",16,"['biography', 'graphic', 'history']"

XIX y con su mensaje, va a disfrutar de un cómic interesante. En él encontrará un sucinto resumen, desarrollado en bellos dibujos, de la vida adulta de Thoreau. Los dos órdenes que hicieron notable al filósofo norteamericano están aquí representados, tanto su ideología política como su elogio de una vida retirada, de retorno a la naturaleza. Su defensa del abolicionismo -aunque activa, al margen de la violencia- fue quizás la forma en la que más directamente llevaría a la práctica la tesis por la que posteriormente sería reivindicado: la desobediencia civil. Aunque quizás, tal como muestra este cómic, su mayor rebelíon fue la de intentar llevar a cabo una vida apartada de la sociedad, el regreso a los valores primigenios de la naturaleza. Vivir la vida en sí misma, ausente de las cargas con las que la sociedad industrial y tecnológica nos marca, supone, hoy más que nunca en nuestro mundo globalizado, una revolución individual y social. Si el mensaje político de Thoreau, la rebelión contra el propio Estado que impone normas abusivas a sus ciudadanos, está más vivo que nunca, su reivindicación de otra forma de vida va quedando en manos minoritarias, minimizada por una Humanidad uniforme, más dependiente cada vez de su propia tecnología. El magnífico apartado gráfico de esta obra, hermoso en los paisajes, en las soledades de Thoreau, invita a romper con esa monotonía. A desconectarse, salir al monte y sentir el disfrute de, sencilla y llanamente, estar.Menos móviles, más Thoreau.",5,[]

Helen,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10027414-helen,4,"December 4, 2019","This is a very interesting graphic novel treatment of the life of the famous philosopher, writer, and activist Henry David Thoreau. I had only an inkling of the scope of Thoreau's thoughts and activities - mainly, the usual impression of a philosopher, proto-environmentalist, observing nature at Walden Pond. I had no idea he was a fierce opponent of slavery and a supporter even of John Brown, who was hanged for trying to incite a slave revolt at Harper's Ferry, Virginia. Thoreau was steadfastly real - kept to his principles no matter what - and his integrity (even if you didn't always agree with him) was what must have most impressed his listeners or readers. He was the opposite of a go-getter capitalist type - withdrawing to the pond, he reached for philosophical wisdom through hiking, observing nature, writing, reading - leading a very austere, scholarly existence for some years (although he was only a few miles from his family home). He was probably reacting to the waves of development and coming industrialization of the northeast - the mills in Massachusetts for example. It may be a stretch to compare him to Marx - but in both in a way were reacting to the Industrial Revolution and what it was doing to humanity. This GN is a good introduction to the complex life of a great American philosopher. It's well-drawn and the limited/muted color palette seems to evoke the 19th C; the text is likewise clear and understandable. Some quotes:""[Thoreau:] [The Brahmins] ... have understood for a long time that possessions end up possessing the being."" ""[Thoreau:] [It doesn't] matter how valuable law may be to protect your property, even to keep soul and body together, if it do not keep you and humanity together."" ""[Thoreau:] I hear many condemn [John Brown and his] ... men because they were so few. When were the good and the brave ever in a majority?"" ""[Thoreau:] [John Brown] ... liberated men from slavery... He is his own savior, but not an earthly one. And although he has nothing, he has everything..."" From the essay by Professor Michael Granger, which is included in the book after the GN:""It was his opinion and abjection of slavery that made him reflect on the individual citizen's relationship to government: how does one behave when faced with laws that do not respect what the knew to be universal moral principles? Early in his life, he believed that conscientious objection, in which the act of non participation is innate, would be an appropriate response."" ""...Thoreau defined a good life, to be made up of one's own culture, of voluntary simplicity, and of resistance to money and consumption."" ""Writing though the middle of the 19th century, he lived in a time of incredible technological innovation. It would be easy to paint Thoreau as a Luddite because of his dismissal of fashion, consumerism, technological innovation, and capitalism. Living this way today would classify him as a reactionary or an extreme conservative."" ""...he viciously criticized religion as stifling the individual and keeping it from evolving."" ""...he was a social progressive, all without ever taking part in any organization of reformers or accepting to be a member of a political party. His assiduous and methodical observation of nature that drove him to develop an ecological vision remain pertinent even today."" ""...he knew how to expertly talk about the simple life and of resistance to institutions and to traditions that abuse free thought."" ""...he did not adhere to any organizations, as he expected very little good to come from a group of men."" ""...he believed in the necessity of preserving nature, forests and other naturally aesthetic sites, by pulling the responsibility of its protection from landowners so as to entrust it to the community.""",0,[]
Ben Truong,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77170844-ben-truong,3,"August 4, 2021","Thoreau: A Sublime Life is a graphic novel written and by Maximilien Le Roy and illustrated by A. Dan. It tells the life of a classic philosopher with an eye to modern concerns and context.Henry David Thoreau was an American naturalist, essayist, poet, and philosopher. A leading transcendentalist, he is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay Civil Disobedience – an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.Le Roy's foreword establishes his perspective, to show the various aspects of Henry David Thoreau's life as the father figure of civil disobedience: pacifist, abolitionist, philosopher, naturist, but one who sought to live his ideas in concrete, everyday experience. By subsuming the reader in Thoreau's day-to-day existence, his concerns come alive not as historical, in the years leading up to the Civil War, but as relevant to those seeking authenticity today. It’s a heady experience, being so caught up in another's life so effectively.Thoreau: A Sublime Life is written and constructed moderately well. Dan and Le Roy argue that Thoreau was no intellectual scribbling in the woods, but a radical dreamer who had it in him to try to bring down the state. By showing Thoreau as the fiery abolitionist, who helped slaves escape to freedom, the outlaw arrested for not paying his taxes in opposition to slavery and the Mexican War, the appreciator of other cultures, and the revolutionary, who met and agreed with John Brown in wonderful fluid art.A six-page ending essay by Michel Granger, a professor specializing in Thoreau’s life and work, discusses his political positions and philosophies. Granger makes a case for Thoreau’s status as a rebel that goes beyond the catchphrase of civil disobedience.All in all, Thoreau: A Sublime Life is gives a luminous light to one of America’s most stirring writers of conscience.",0,"['biography', 'environment', 'essays']"

Sitting on the library shelf, it seemed like it would be similar to the graphic novel Monet, which I found fantastic. Let me preface this by saying I rarely give one-star reviews. It is very hard for me to dislike a book enough to give it the lowest designation. As a writer, that hurts my soul. However, there were critical mistakes made all around. The writing style was dull, but that might have been because the story was so sanitized of content and details that there wasn't any writing that could have salvaged the narrative. I've read actual accounts of Thoreau that aren't the children's-book version that makes him seem like America's Plato. This read like the latter and not the former, except the kids' book gets a better rendition than what was typed out here. Speaking of typed out, they didn't mind the rules of comic dialogue. The speech bubbles were out of order more than once or it was hard to designate which illustrated character was speaking. The artwork was fine, but no more than that. In the version for Monet, they used his impressionist style and actual imprints of his work within the comic illustrations. Thoreau is just a philosopher, if that. I can't tell fully from this book alone.",0,['graphic-novel']

While it was full of nuggets of wisdom, it was a lot - and I couldn't help but feel some kind of abridged version would benefit many readers. Upon review, there are two Thoreau-based graphic novels out there - this one and Thoreau at Walden. Much of the review for this book, as well as Thoreau at Walden will be comparing the two to help you choose the best graphic novel, if any, to pick up.1. These are both excellent graphic novels. I gave both 4-stars and, while there is some overlap, it wouldn't be too redundant to own both books. Thoreau at Walden focuses almost completely on his time at Walden and the origin and influence of Civil Disobedience while this book is more of a biography that contains a smaller part dedicated to his time at Walden. This book also shows his evolution from the origins of Civil Disobedience to supporting the violent methods of John Brown. Much of this book is about the abolitionist movement that Thoreau was a supporter of, as well as other parts of his life, presumably taken from his journals.2. Both books capture much of the serene, non-conformist, spirit of Thoreau, both are quick reads, and both books have excellent introductions and end notes.3. The art styles of each book are different. This book has a more realistic art style while Thoreau at Walden has a more cartoony style. You may want to check out samples of each to see which art style you prefer. I, personally, liked both art styles plenty.4. And, finally, both books have plenty of Thoreau quotes to capture his essence and get you started, but not enough for my liking. The man is so damn quotable. There are plenty of Thoreau quote books like The Quotable Thoreau or The Daily Henry David Thoreau: A Year of Quotes from the Man Who Lived in Season that would surely make a great companion to either or both of these graphic novels.Anyway, I enjoyed this graphic novel, as well as Thoreau at Walden, and recommend adding either or both to your library.",0,"['adaptations-and-retellings', 'anti-consumerism', 'graphic-novels']"

La vida sublime” es una novela gráfica que nos sitúa a mediados del siglo XIX e intenta condensar la vida y pensamientos del filósofo, escritor y naturalista estadounidense Henry David Thoreau.Me han gustado los dibujos y los colores, que resultan muy “otoñales” (marrones, verdes, ocres…) y que plasman la pasión y comunión que Thoreau sentía por la naturaleza. Así se inicia la historia, en 1845 el protagonista decide irse a vivir al bosque, en una cabaña que él mismo construye y donde vivirá dos años (experiencia que narraría en “Walden”, su obra más conocida). Bellas ilustraciones y poco texto, pero el suficiente para mostrarnos fragmentos de su vida y sus ideas más importantes. Encarcelado por negarse a pagar impuestos, que no reconoce el gobierno de la esclavitud e incita a la revolución, a Thoreau se le considera el padre de la “desobediencia civil” e influyó en otros “rebeldes” como Gandhi o Martin Luther King.Como complemento a la obra gráfica y valor añadido, destacan el prólogo, que sirve de introducción al filósofo y escritor, y especialmente la entrevista final a Michel Granger, profesor de literatura especialista en Thoreau y cuyas palabras resultan muy aclaratorias.Esta biografía en forma de cómic nos da solo una visión parcial de la vida y pensamientos de Thoreau, sin duda hay que leer su obra para conocerlo en profundidad, pero me parece un acercamiento muy interesante al autor.

This one was short and the art is great, but the snapshot of Thoreau is very limited and obscure actually -- maybe his writing is difficult for me to understand, because there were several quotes included in the text and I really didn't get a great feel for Thoreau. The best part was the afterword by a Thoreau and Emerson scholar. It's a few pages pretty much debunking the content of the graphic novel that focuses on HDT's Walden Pond time (just two years and a few miles from his parents' house, who he lived with the rest of his life), and some on his philosophy that A. Dan calls ""civil disobedience"" in the foreword (which is also poorly translated from French, weird in this modern day of many talented translators.) The afterword claims HDT was apolitical, a writer and scholar more than anything, and got more attention in recent decades for his supposed non-violent stance that wasn't accurate. I didn't really know anything about HDT except he was a naturalist and beloved thinker, so it was all new to me. I appreciated learning about his abolitionist beliefs and activism (he did help slaves and spoke out about it in speeches.) He also abstained from paying taxes because he didn't believe in the government's use of the money for the Mexican War and slavery, but the afterword said those were small parts of his life.",0,[]

That...really taints the view of him as some romantic figure. TBH, he sounds like a rather privileged person that had the luxury to have very ""high minded"" thoughts and ""rebel."" I think it's important to recognize that while he was disdained some people as having an empty life, if one wants everyone to choose their own paths, you're not always going to agree with their choices. It doesn't make someone's life empty simply because they chose things you would not.

XIX y con su mensaje, va a disfrutar de un cómic interesante. En él encontrará un sucinto resumen, desarrollado en bellos dibujos, de la vida adulta de Thoreau. Los dos órdenes que hicieron notable al filósofo norteamericano están aquí representados, tanto su ideología política como su elogio de una vida retirada, de retorno a la naturaleza. Su defensa del abolicionismo -aunque activa, al margen de la violencia- fue quizás la forma en la que más directamente llevaría a la práctica la tesis por la que posteriormente sería reivindicado: la desobediencia civil. Aunque quizás, tal como muestra este cómic, su mayor rebelíon fue la de intentar llevar a cabo una vida apartada de la sociedad, el regreso a los valores primigenios de la naturaleza. Vivir la vida en sí misma, ausente de las cargas con las que la sociedad industrial y tecnológica nos marca, supone, hoy más que nunca en nuestro mundo globalizado, una revolución individual y social. Si el mensaje político de Thoreau, la rebelión contra el propio Estado que impone normas abusivas a sus ciudadanos, está más vivo que nunca, su reivindicación de otra forma de vida va quedando en manos minoritarias, minimizada por una Humanidad uniforme, más dependiente cada vez de su propia tecnología. El magnífico apartado gráfico de esta obra, hermoso en los paisajes, en las soledades de Thoreau, invita a romper con esa monotonía. A desconectarse, salir al monte y sentir el disfrute de, sencilla y llanamente, estar.Menos móviles, más Thoreau.",5,[]

Helen,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10027414-helen,4,"December 4, 2019","This is a very interesting graphic novel treatment of the life of the famous philosopher, writer, and activist Henry David Thoreau. I had only an inkling of the scope of Thoreau's thoughts and activities - mainly, the usual impression of a philosopher, proto-environmentalist, observing nature at Walden Pond. I had no idea he was a fierce opponent of slavery and a supporter even of John Brown, who was hanged for trying to incite a slave revolt at Harper's Ferry, Virginia. Thoreau was steadfastly real - kept to his principles no matter what - and his integrity (even if you didn't always agree with him) was what must have most impressed his listeners or readers. He was the opposite of a go-getter capitalist type - withdrawing to the pond, he reached for philosophical wisdom through hiking, observing nature, writing, reading - leading a very austere, scholarly existence for some years (although he was only a few miles from his family home). He was probably reacting to the waves of development and coming industrialization of the northeast - the mills in Massachusetts for example. It may be a stretch to compare him to Marx - but in both in a way were reacting to the Industrial Revolution and what it was doing to humanity. This GN is a good introduction to the complex life of a great American philosopher. It's well-drawn and the limited/muted color palette seems to evoke the 19th C; the text is likewise clear and understandable. Some quotes:""[Thoreau:] [The Brahmins] ... have understood for a long time that possessions end up possessing the being."" ""[Thoreau:] [It doesn't] matter how valuable law may be to protect your property, even to keep soul and body together, if it do not keep you and humanity together."" ""[Thoreau:] I hear many condemn [John Brown and his] ... men because they were so few. When were the good and the brave ever in a majority?"" ""[Thoreau:] [John Brown] ... liberated men from slavery... He is his own savior, but not an earthly one. And although he has nothing, he has everything..."" From the essay by Professor Michael Granger, which is included in the book after the GN:""It was his opinion and abjection of slavery that made him reflect on the individual citizen's relationship to government: how does one behave when faced with laws that do not respect what the knew to be universal moral principles? Early in his life, he believed that conscientious objection, in which the act of non participation is innate, would be an appropriate response."" ""...Thoreau defined a good life, to be made up of one's own culture, of voluntary simplicity, and of resistance to money and consumption."" ""Writing though the middle of the 19th century, he lived in a time of incredible technological innovation. It would be easy to paint Thoreau as a Luddite because of his dismissal of fashion, consumerism, technological innovation, and capitalism. Living this way today would classify him as a reactionary or an extreme conservative."" ""...he viciously criticized religion as stifling the individual and keeping it from evolving."" ""...he was a social progressive, all without ever taking part in any organization of reformers or accepting to be a member of a political party. His assiduous and methodical observation of nature that drove him to develop an ecological vision remain pertinent even today."" ""...he knew how to expertly talk about the simple life and of resistance to institutions and to traditions that abuse free thought."" ""...he did not adhere to any organizations, as he expected very little good to come from a group of men."" ""...he believed in the necessity of preserving nature, forests and other naturally aesthetic sites, by pulling the responsibility of its protection from landowners so as to entrust it to the community.""",0,[]

It tells the life of a classic philosopher with an eye to modern concerns and context.Henry David Thoreau was an American naturalist, essayist, poet, and philosopher. A leading transcendentalist, he is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay Civil Disobedience – an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.Le Roy's foreword establishes his perspective, to show the various aspects of Henry David Thoreau's life as the father figure of civil disobedience: pacifist, abolitionist, philosopher, naturist, but one who sought to live his ideas in concrete, everyday experience. By subsuming the reader in Thoreau's day-to-day existence, his concerns come alive not as historical, in the years leading up to the Civil War, but as relevant to those seeking authenticity today. It’s a heady experience, being so caught up in another's life so effectively.Thoreau: A Sublime Life is written and constructed moderately well. Dan and Le Roy argue that Thoreau was no intellectual scribbling in the woods, but a radical dreamer who had it in him to try to bring down the state. By showing Thoreau as the fiery abolitionist, who helped slaves escape to freedom, the outlaw arrested for not paying his taxes in opposition to slavery and the Mexican War, the appreciator of other cultures, and the revolutionary, who met and agreed with John Brown in wonderful fluid art.A six-page ending essay by Michel Granger, a professor specializing in Thoreau’s life and work, discusses his political positions and philosophies. Granger makes a case for Thoreau’s status as a rebel that goes beyond the catchphrase of civil disobedience.All in all, Thoreau: A Sublime Life is gives a luminous light to one of America’s most stirring writers of conscience.",0,"['biography', 'environment', 'essays']"

Sitting on the library shelf, it seemed like it would be similar to the graphic novel Monet, which I found fantastic. Let me preface this by saying I rarely give one-star reviews. It is very hard for me to dislike a book enough to give it the lowest designation. As a writer, that hurts my soul. However, there were critical mistakes made all around. The writing style was dull, but that might have been because the story was so sanitized of content and details that there wasn't any writing that could have salvaged the narrative. I've read actual accounts of Thoreau that aren't the children's-book version that makes him seem like America's Plato. This read like the latter and not the former, except the kids' book gets a better rendition than what was typed out here. Speaking of typed out, they didn't mind the rules of comic dialogue. The speech bubbles were out of order more than once or it was hard to designate which illustrated character was speaking. The artwork was fine, but no more than that. In the version for Monet, they used his impressionist style and actual imprints of his work within the comic illustrations. Thoreau is just a philosopher, if that.

While it was full of nuggets of wisdom, it was a lot - and I couldn't help but feel some kind of abridged version would benefit many readers. Upon review, there are two Thoreau-based graphic novels out there - this one and Thoreau at Walden. Much of the review for this book, as well as Thoreau at Walden will be comparing the two to help you choose the best graphic novel, if any, to pick up.1. These are both excellent graphic novels. I gave both 4-stars and, while there is some overlap, it wouldn't be too redundant to own both books. Thoreau at Walden focuses almost completely on his time at Walden and the origin and influence of Civil Disobedience while this book is more of a biography that contains a smaller part dedicated to his time at Walden. This book also shows his evolution from the origins of Civil Disobedience to supporting the violent methods of John Brown. Much of this book is about the abolitionist movement that Thoreau was a supporter of, as well as other parts of his life, presumably taken from his journals.2. Both books capture much of the serene, non-conformist, spirit of Thoreau, both are quick reads, and both books have excellent introductions and end notes.3. The art styles of each book are different. This book has a more realistic art style while Thoreau at Walden has a more cartoony style. You may want to check out samples of each to see which art style you prefer. I, personally, liked both art styles plenty.4. And, finally, both books have plenty of Thoreau quotes to capture his essence and get you started, but not enough for my liking. The man is so damn quotable. There are plenty of Thoreau quote books like The Quotable Thoreau or The Daily Henry David Thoreau: A Year of Quotes from the Man Who Lived in Season that would surely make a great companion to either or both of these graphic novels.Anyway, I enjoyed this graphic novel, as well as Thoreau at Walden, and recommend adding either or both to your library.",0,"['adaptations-and-retellings', 'anti-consumerism', 'graphic-novels']"

La vida sublime” es una novela gráfica que nos sitúa a mediados del siglo XIX e intenta condensar la vida y pensamientos del filósofo, escritor y naturalista estadounidense Henry David Thoreau.Me han gustado los dibujos y los colores, que resultan muy “otoñales” (marrones, verdes, ocres…) y que plasman la pasión y comunión que Thoreau sentía por la naturaleza. Así se inicia la historia, en 1845 el protagonista decide irse a vivir al bosque, en una cabaña que él mismo construye y donde vivirá dos años (experiencia que narraría en “Walden”, su obra más conocida). Bellas ilustraciones y poco texto, pero el suficiente para mostrarnos fragmentos de su vida y sus ideas más importantes. Encarcelado por negarse a pagar impuestos, que no reconoce el gobierno de la esclavitud e incita a la revolución, a Thoreau se le considera el padre de la “desobediencia civil” e influyó en otros “rebeldes” como Gandhi o Martin Luther King.Como complemento a la obra gráfica y valor añadido, destacan el prólogo, que sirve de introducción al filósofo y escritor, y especialmente la entrevista final a Michel Granger, profesor de literatura especialista en Thoreau y cuyas palabras resultan muy aclaratorias.Esta biografía en forma de cómic nos da solo una visión parcial de la vida y pensamientos de Thoreau, sin duda hay que leer su obra para conocerlo en profundidad, pero me parece un acercamiento muy interesante al autor.

This one was short and the art is great, but the snapshot of Thoreau is very limited and obscure actually -- maybe his writing is difficult for me to understand, because there were several quotes included in the text and I really didn't get a great feel for Thoreau. The best part was the afterword by a Thoreau and Emerson scholar. It's a few pages pretty much debunking the content of the graphic novel that focuses on HDT's Walden Pond time (just two years and a few miles from his parents' house, who he lived with the rest of his life), and some on his philosophy that A. Dan calls ""civil disobedience"" in the foreword (which is also poorly translated from French, weird in this modern day of many talented translators.) The afterword claims HDT was apolitical, a writer and scholar more than anything, and got more attention in recent decades for his supposed non-violent stance that wasn't accurate. I didn't really know anything about HDT except he was a naturalist and beloved thinker, so it was all new to me. I appreciated learning about his abolitionist beliefs and activism (he did help slaves and spoke out about it in speeches.) He also abstained from paying taxes because he didn't believe in the government's use of the money for the Mexican War and slavery, but the afterword said those were small parts of his life.",0,[]

That...really taints the view of him as some romantic figure. TBH, he sounds like a rather privileged person that had the luxury to have very ""high minded"" thoughts and ""rebel."" I think it's important to recognize that while he was disdained some people as having an empty life, if one wants everyone to choose their own paths, you're not always going to agree with their choices.

I found the disjointed story line a bit simplistic and elementary. The essay included after the graphic story, by Thoreau scholar, Michael Granger, was highly insightful. Granger places Thoreau's life and ideas in historical context. He argues that the traditional image of Thoreau as a ""non-violent"" ""wise man,"" is a cliche, pointing out that some of Thoreau's speeches support armed resistance, especially concerning overthrowing the institution of slavery. Granger concludes that it would be more accurate to call Thoreau a ""rebel"" than a ""civil disobedient"" (which is a 20th Century label). Thoreau's defense of the rebel of John Brown testifies to that, an episode which is briefly depicted in the graphic biography.

Dave Schaafsma,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma,4,"August 16, 2017","Thoreau: A Sublime Life is a short, evocative comics biography by French team, writer Maximilien Roy and A. Dan (Daniel Alexandre). It’s not a mere chronological biography—it’s too short for that—but even it were twice the length they wouldn't have been interested in that. What they want to do is create a comics portrait of Thoreau through images and ideas, snapshots more than film, poetic images more than an in-depth philosophical biography. It’s their image of Thoreau. I know Thoreau’s work, or did, and I bet most of you are familiar with him and can say a few things about him. Walden, “On Civil Disobedience.” I have a picture book of him called Henry (in part because I have a son, Henry) that I like, too.This bio of Thoreau features some quotations from him with which I was unfamiliar. For instance, Thoreau taught for a short time in the Concord School. He hated the regimentation, the required discipline, so he schooled kids in his home, with his brother: “We came up with new approaches to education, outings in nature, more active participation with students, no more corporal punishment.” I’d like to know more about his approach, but we only get this glimpse. But you can build a whole educational philosophy based on that glimpse!“I just want everyone to explore their own path.”And on the environment and man’s historical ignorant rapacious use of it: “If a man walks in the woods for love of them, for half the day, he is in danger of being a loafer; but if he spends his whole day as a speculator, shearing off those woods, and making the earth bald before her time, he is esteemed an industrious and enterprising citizen.”“Wanting to be famous means wanting to be contaminated.”He read as deeply into Buddhism and Hinduism as Christianity. “The Brahmins understood that possessions end up possessing us.”Thoreau was more spiritual than political, in general, though he was adamantaly opposed to slavery, he hated the US-Mexican War, and he wouldn’t pay taxes to a government that thrived from such activities. He was also an anarchist of sorts, who preferred the road less travelled and improvisation to authoritarian structures. He was an ecologist, and environmentalist, and we need him again, as always.Michael Granger’s short essay on Thoreau completes the book, which I liked very much. The art from A. Dan, who studied biology and ecology, is great.",33,"['environment', 'gn-bio', 'philosophy']"

It's interesting how many biographical graphic novels are produced in Europe about cultural figures in the U.S. — and they do such a good job of it.Thoreau is a writer who is often romanticized, and this book does not avoid that tendency. The essay at the end, by Professor Michel Granger, provides more insight and background. The famous cabin on Walden's Pond, for instance, is usually described as ""secluded"" but was only a few miles from the family home—the essay does mention that, but when Thoreau is portrayed as living a life of freedom and independence at his cabin, it goes unsaid that his mother and sisters were delivering meals and doing his laundry. So much for living outside the structures of society.Thoreau remains a huge influence for his idealistic approach to nature and living in freedom and splendid isolation.

XIX y con su mensaje, va a disfrutar de un cómic interesante. En él encontrará un sucinto resumen, desarrollado en bellos dibujos, de la vida adulta de Thoreau. Los dos órdenes que hicieron notable al filósofo norteamericano están aquí representados, tanto su ideología política como su elogio de una vida retirada, de retorno a la naturaleza. Su defensa del abolicionismo -aunque activa, al margen de la violencia- fue quizás la forma en la que más directamente llevaría a la práctica la tesis por la que posteriormente sería reivindicado: la desobediencia civil. Aunque quizás, tal como muestra este cómic, su mayor rebelíon fue la de intentar llevar a cabo una vida apartada de la sociedad, el regreso a los valores primigenios de la naturaleza. Vivir la vida en sí misma, ausente de las cargas con las que la sociedad industrial y tecnológica nos marca, supone, hoy más que nunca en nuestro mundo globalizado, una revolución individual y social. Si el mensaje político de Thoreau, la rebelión contra el propio Estado que impone normas abusivas a sus ciudadanos, está más vivo que nunca, su reivindicación de otra forma de vida va quedando en manos minoritarias, minimizada por una Humanidad uniforme, más dependiente cada vez de su propia tecnología.

Helen,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10027414-helen,4,"December 4, 2019","This is a very interesting graphic novel treatment of the life of the famous philosopher, writer, and activist Henry David Thoreau. I had only an inkling of the scope of Thoreau's thoughts and activities - mainly, the usual impression of a philosopher, proto-environmentalist, observing nature at Walden Pond. I had no idea he was a fierce opponent of slavery and a supporter even of John Brown, who was hanged for trying to incite a slave revolt at Harper's Ferry, Virginia. Thoreau was steadfastly real - kept to his principles no matter what - and his integrity (even if you didn't always agree with him) was what must have most impressed his listeners or readers. He was the opposite of a go-getter capitalist type - withdrawing to the pond, he reached for philosophical wisdom through hiking, observing nature, writing, reading - leading a very austere, scholarly existence for some years (although he was only a few miles from his family home). He was probably reacting to the waves of development and coming industrialization of the northeast - the mills in Massachusetts for example. It may be a stretch to compare him to Marx - but in both in a way were reacting to the Industrial Revolution and what it was doing to humanity. This GN is a good introduction to the complex life of a great American philosopher. It's well-drawn and the limited/muted color palette seems to evoke the 19th C; the text is likewise clear and understandable. Some quotes:""[Thoreau:] [The Brahmins] ... have understood for a long time that possessions end up possessing the being."" ""[Thoreau:] [It doesn't] matter how valuable law may be to protect your property, even to keep soul and body together, if it do not keep you and humanity together."" ""[Thoreau:] I hear many condemn [John Brown and his] ... men because they were so few. When were the good and the brave ever in a majority?"" ""[Thoreau:] [John Brown] ... liberated men from slavery... He is his own savior, but not an earthly one. And although he has nothing, he has everything..."" From the essay by Professor Michael Granger, which is included in the book after the GN:""It was his opinion and abjection of slavery that made him reflect on the individual citizen's relationship to government: how does one behave when faced with laws that do not respect what the knew to be universal moral principles? Early in his life, he believed that conscientious objection, in which the act of non participation is innate, would be an appropriate response."" ""...Thoreau defined a good life, to be made up of one's own culture, of voluntary simplicity, and of resistance to money and consumption."" ""Writing though the middle of the 19th century, he lived in a time of incredible technological innovation. It would be easy to paint Thoreau as a Luddite because of his dismissal of fashion, consumerism, technological innovation, and capitalism. Living this way today would classify him as a reactionary or an extreme conservative."" ""...he viciously criticized religion as stifling the individual and keeping it from evolving."" ""...he was a social progressive, all without ever taking part in any organization of reformers or accepting to be a member of a political party. His assiduous and methodical observation of nature that drove him to develop an ecological vision remain pertinent even today."" ""...he knew how to expertly talk about the simple life and of resistance to institutions and to traditions that abuse free thought."" ""...he did not adhere to any organizations, as he expected very little good to come from a group of men."" ""...he believed in the necessity of preserving nature, forests and other naturally aesthetic sites, by pulling the responsibility of its protection from landowners so as to entrust it to the community.""",0,[]

It tells the life of a classic philosopher with an eye to modern concerns and context.Henry David Thoreau was an American naturalist, essayist, poet, and philosopher. A leading transcendentalist, he is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay Civil Disobedience – an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.Le Roy's foreword establishes his perspective, to show the various aspects of Henry David Thoreau's life as the father figure of civil disobedience: pacifist, abolitionist, philosopher, naturist, but one who sought to live his ideas in concrete, everyday experience. By subsuming the reader in Thoreau's day-to-day existence, his concerns come alive not as historical, in the years leading up to the Civil War, but as relevant to those seeking authenticity today. It’s a heady experience, being so caught up in another's life so effectively.Thoreau: A Sublime Life is written and constructed moderately well. Dan and Le Roy argue that Thoreau was no intellectual scribbling in the woods, but a radical dreamer who had it in him to try to bring down the state. By showing Thoreau as the fiery abolitionist, who helped slaves escape to freedom, the outlaw arrested for not paying his taxes in opposition to slavery and the Mexican War, the appreciator of other cultures, and the revolutionary, who met and agreed with John Brown in wonderful fluid art.A six-page ending essay by Michel Granger, a professor specializing in Thoreau’s life and work, discusses his political positions and philosophies.

It is very hard for me to dislike a book enough to give it the lowest designation. As a writer, that hurts my soul. However, there were critical mistakes made all around. The writing style was dull, but that might have been because the story was so sanitized of content and details that there wasn't any writing that could have salvaged the narrative. I've read actual accounts of Thoreau that aren't the children's-book version that makes him seem like America's Plato. This read like the latter and not the former, except the kids' book gets a better rendition than what was typed out here. Speaking of typed out, they didn't mind the rules of comic dialogue. The speech bubbles were out of order more than once or it was hard to designate which illustrated character was speaking. The artwork was fine, but no more than that.

While it was full of nuggets of wisdom, it was a lot - and I couldn't help but feel some kind of abridged version would benefit many readers. Upon review, there are two Thoreau-based graphic novels out there - this one and Thoreau at Walden. Much of the review for this book, as well as Thoreau at Walden will be comparing the two to help you choose the best graphic novel, if any, to pick up.1. These are both excellent graphic novels. I gave both 4-stars and, while there is some overlap, it wouldn't be too redundant to own both books. Thoreau at Walden focuses almost completely on his time at Walden and the origin and influence of Civil Disobedience while this book is more of a biography that contains a smaller part dedicated to his time at Walden. This book also shows his evolution from the origins of Civil Disobedience to supporting the violent methods of John Brown. Much of this book is about the abolitionist movement that Thoreau was a supporter of, as well as other parts of his life, presumably taken from his journals.2. Both books capture much of the serene, non-conformist, spirit of Thoreau, both are quick reads, and both books have excellent introductions and end notes.3. The art styles of each book are different. This book has a more realistic art style while Thoreau at Walden has a more cartoony style. You may want to check out samples of each to see which art style you prefer. I, personally, liked both art styles plenty.4. And, finally, both books have plenty of Thoreau quotes to capture his essence and get you started, but not enough for my liking. The man is so damn quotable. There are plenty of Thoreau quote books like The Quotable Thoreau or The Daily Henry David Thoreau: A Year of Quotes from the Man Who Lived in Season that would surely make a great companion to either or both of these graphic novels.Anyway, I enjoyed this graphic novel, as well as Thoreau at Walden, and recommend adding either or both to your library.",0,"['adaptations-and-retellings', 'anti-consumerism', 'graphic-novels']"

La vida sublime” es una novela gráfica que nos sitúa a mediados del siglo XIX e intenta condensar la vida y pensamientos del filósofo, escritor y naturalista estadounidense Henry David Thoreau.Me han gustado los dibujos y los colores, que resultan muy “otoñales” (marrones, verdes, ocres…) y que plasman la pasión y comunión que Thoreau sentía por la naturaleza. Así se inicia la historia, en 1845 el protagonista decide irse a vivir al bosque, en una cabaña que él mismo construye y donde vivirá dos años (experiencia que narraría en “Walden”, su obra más conocida). Bellas ilustraciones y poco texto, pero el suficiente para mostrarnos fragmentos de su vida y sus ideas más importantes. Encarcelado por negarse a pagar impuestos, que no reconoce el gobierno de la esclavitud e incita a la revolución, a Thoreau se le considera el padre de la “desobediencia civil” e influyó en otros “rebeldes” como Gandhi o Martin Luther King.Como complemento a la obra gráfica y valor añadido, destacan el prólogo, que sirve de introducción al filósofo y escritor, y especialmente la entrevista final a Michel Granger, profesor de literatura especialista en Thoreau y cuyas palabras resultan muy aclaratorias.Esta biografía en forma de cómic nos da solo una visión parcial de la vida y pensamientos de Thoreau, sin duda hay que leer su obra para conocerlo en profundidad, pero me parece un acercamiento muy interesante al autor. Y el efecto visual de la obra en su conjunto creo que se corresponde fielmente al sentir del protagonista.",0,[]
Cristina,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/760135-cristina,4,"February 11, 2020","Last month I grabbed several graphic novels from the display at the library celebrating biographies and other historical stories told as comics. This one was short and the art is great, but the snapshot of Thoreau is very limited and obscure actually -- maybe his writing is difficult for me to understand, because there were several quotes included in the text and I really didn't get a great feel for Thoreau. The best part was the afterword by a Thoreau and Emerson scholar. It's a few pages pretty much debunking the content of the graphic novel that focuses on HDT's Walden Pond time (just two years and a few miles from his parents' house, who he lived with the rest of his life), and some on his philosophy that A. Dan calls ""civil disobedience"" in the foreword (which is also poorly translated from French, weird in this modern day of many talented translators.) The afterword claims HDT was apolitical, a writer and scholar more than anything, and got more attention in recent decades for his supposed non-violent stance that wasn't accurate. I didn't really know anything about HDT except he was a naturalist and beloved thinker, so it was all new to me. I appreciated learning about his abolitionist beliefs and activism (he did help slaves and spoke out about it in speeches.) He also abstained from paying taxes because he didn't believe in the government's use of the money for the Mexican War and slavery, but the afterword said those were small parts of his life.",0,[]
Jennifer,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22757106-jennifer,3,"May 13, 2024","I only vaguely knew Thoreau as a naturalist, so this was an interesting glimpse into a different side of him. An abolitionist, a philosopher, and...I guess you can call him a theoretical revolutionist? It sounds like he had a lot of opinions but did not necessarily act.Another review mentions that despite his ""solitude"" in the woods, his mother and sister regularly brought him meals and did his laundry. That...really taints the view of him as some romantic figure. TBH, he sounds like a rather privileged person that had the luxury to have very ""high minded"" thoughts and ""rebel."" I think it's important to recognize that while he was disdained some people as having an empty life, if one wants everyone to choose their own paths, you're not always going to agree with their choices. It doesn't make someone's life empty simply because they chose things you would not. Overall I would judge him as being a bit pretentious.The artwork suited this type of story, though it's not to my personal taste.",0,[]
Rgoldenberg,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29977167-rgoldenberg,3,"May 22, 2019","I especially enjoyed A-Dan's artwork, specifically the New England landscapes, reminiscent of watercolor paintings. I found the disjointed story line a bit simplistic and elementary. The essay included after the graphic story, by Thoreau scholar, Michael Granger, was highly insightful. Granger places Thoreau's life and ideas in historical context. He argues that the traditional image of Thoreau as a ""non-violent"" ""wise man,"" is a cliche, pointing out that some of Thoreau's speeches support armed resistance, especially concerning overthrowing the institution of slavery. Granger concludes that it would be more accurate to call Thoreau a ""rebel"" than a ""civil disobedient"" (which is a 20th Century label). Thoreau's defense of the rebel of John Brown testifies to that, an episode which is briefly depicted in the graphic biography. I would recommend this work because it aims to debunk traditional or simplistic views of Thoreau, forcing the reader to see him in a new light.",0,"['graphic-novels-read', 'nonfiction-read', 'philosophy-read']"

I got a job as an elevator operator in a hospital one summer and, after visiting hours, when things calmed down, I had about four hours per night. The books I read that summer were Moby Dick (unabridged), War and Peace (unabridged), and Thoreau's Walden and Essay on Civil Disobedience. Three books that changed my world view (at age 17).My Number One Daughter-in-Law gave me graphic novel for Christmas, and what a marvelous gift it is.

Entre ellas, la de la vida de Saulo de Tarso, que narraba su conversión. Era un tebeo sencillo de inspiración franco belga (eso pienso ahora sin tenerlo delante) que te acercaba a las grandes historias de la Biblia. Pues este comic es así, pero con Thoreau. Para un adulto o para alguien que esté muy familiarizado con el personaje se puede quedar corto, pero para un primer acercamiento es didáctico y entretenido. Más allá de esto, me ha encantado el dibujo, en especial los paisajes y el color. El prólogo y el epílogo también son destacables (la mayoría de las veces tienen 0 interés).

Not much on his spiritual side, but adequate though reductive biographic detail. It can be read in one sitting and offers enjoyable insights into the man and his achievement.",0,[]

The text could also use a proofread (""oldtwon"" and using ""payed"" instead of ""paid"").The worst thing, though, was the inside of characters' mouths being GRAY. It's surprisingly disturbing.
