Dave Schaafsma,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma,5,"March 16, 2019","Thanks to netgalley.com for the advance look.I like the Stones, and have seen them 2-3 times. There are probably hundreds of books about them, several in each library. Well, this is another one and like most of them it is for fans about The Greatest Rock Band of All Time (I'm not going to argue about that here). It has several prose introductions to topics, it has fan friendly photos of the band from across the decades, and 21 short comics about different topics, in different styles. Maybe because I am reading Catherine Ingram's I Am series of illustrated board books about artists, written as entertaining and substantive introductions to Great Artists, I was led to reflect on the difference between a puff piece for fans and a biography that doesn't deify, that admits the complications and contradictions of the artists being explored. The aesthetic of the Ceka book is jarring, jumping from photo to prose text to comics. Some of the comics do talk about interesting topics, if you are fan--as with the Fifth Beatle story, there is a little bit here about a fifth Stone piano player--but the overall sense is not of a beautiful interesting book but a series of disconnected factoids and perspectives. Which is fine, just not my cuppa. But I think if you are a true fan and if you are in the comics section of your library, you might want to check this out.",20,"['gn-bio', 'gn-music', 'non-fiction']"
Dave,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35045983-dave,5,"February 15, 2019","NBM Publishing is in the process of putting out a series of music star biography/ coffee table book/ comic strips. Some others feature the Beatles, Elvis and Billie Holliday. Of course, such a series would not be complete without a tribute to the World's Greatest Rock n Roll band: Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones! Chapters alternate between biographical stories and comic art by a variety of artists in a variety of styles, perhaps fitting because along with lunch boxes and T-shirts all kinds of rock paraphernalia were put out back in the day. What was really interesting to me at least was how little of the Stones story I was familiar with though I know ever riff and every lyric. To be honest, it's only a taste of the Stones and, if you are looking for a more in depth treatment of either their catalog or their biographies, there are plenty of other sources. But, the bottom line is that this book is just plain fun to thumb through (even though I'm thumbing digital pages).",14,"['graphic-novels', 'music-books', 'read-have']"
Bandit,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit,5,"October 6, 2021","Céka did a lamentable job with Michael Jackson bio, but this one was pretty decent. Which is to say I learned a lot about the band. These are such strange books, they appear as graphic novels, but content wise they are a mix of biographical essays, quotations and photographs. In fact, the graphics are just a small portion of the total, created by a variety of different artists in a variety of different styles, each one to reference some significant juncture in Rolling Stones’ life. Because of the variety, some of this comic art entries land nicer than others. Some veer too far into cartoonism. Although all have fun interesting colors. This was a commemorative read, of sorts. RIP Charlie Watts. The band itself has exhibited a striking longevity, a very lively and kicking bunch of senior citizens and the book is actually from a few years ago, when Watts was still alive. Mick Jagger is pushing eighty and is still at it, not too shabby for a guy who once said he wanted to quit the business at 33. So, what do we learn from this book outside of the admiration society style biographical narrative? Well, from a modern hyperwoke perspective one can say that a bunch of Englishmen got together, appropriated a variety of black music such as blues and jazz, took a name heavily associated with black culture (slavery link, didn’t know about this at all, very interesting reference) and spun it into decades worth of musical gold, fame and fortune. But really, the more music biographies you read (or watch the cinematic adaptations of), the more you realize it’s literally the same story over and over, just with different players. The exact same curves on the narrative trajectories. Tragically predictable, but those who ride them out apparently become legends, so…who can resist. Overall, a decent book for someone who wants to learn about the band quickly, overview style. Nowhere near as much fun as a Rolling Stones concert, but you know, medium limitations.This and more at https://advancetheplot.weebly.com/",9,[]
Rod Brown,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23954351-rod-brown,5,"November 1, 2019","This book has the slapdash feel of a high school yearbook, but does gives an overview of the history of the Rolling Stones that kept me turning pages briskly. Between the many comic strips with a variety of artists who vary greatly in their ability to capture the likenesses of the members of the band, are a bunch of goofily written and worshipful text pieces and tons of public domain photographs.The historical rigor and editorial philosophy of the book is best summed up by this disclaimer included on the verso page: ""most of the quotes in this book are translated from the French edition, and are therefore not phrased exactly like the original quotes in English."" Isn't there a game people play with Google Translate that does this same thing for laughs? Fortunately, the translator here does a better job of covering up any truly ridiculous gaffes, but it doesn't inspire confidence as to how much of this ""history"" can truly be trusted.",5,[]
Jeff,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6826154-jeff,5,"January 20, 2023","Presenting the history of the Rolling Stones in the form of comics is a great idea, and for the most part, this volume tackles the job very well. Much of the narrative is actually short sections of text which introduce each of the twenty-one comics chapters, but that judicious use of prose allows the book to cover more territory than the graphics could do on their own.Most of the visual sections are by a different comics artist, and those changing visual styles work well to chart the course of changes in the world of the Stones themselves. Given that most of the comics chapters are only five or six pages in length, it's inevitable that not all of the artists have risen to the challenge of creating something notable from a short slice of the Stones biography. But there are standouts, particularly Dmitri Piot, Kyung-Eun Park, and Dominique Hennebaut.For me, the most successful chapter is Anthony Audibert's ""Performance"", which uses Mick Jaggers' role in the film of the same name to explore the free-wheeling sexuality that has always been a big part of the Stones' public persona. Audibert is a truly gifted comics stylist, and his creative approach to his topic stands out from the rather dry biographical facts that most of his peers have chosen to chronicle.",3,[]
Stewart Tame,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,5,"September 11, 2019","This took me longer to finish than I expected. It wasn't any dissatisfaction with the book on my part, but simply because I got sucked into another book--I tend to have two or three books going at a time. Anyway, I finally finished this one.Although the title is The Rolling Stones In Comics, there's actually a fair amount of text as well. The comics portion is a series of vignettes of various stages of the Stones’ career, and the text is a more conventional rock biography that's mostly there to set up the context for each vignette. This was actually a smart move because, without the text, you’d need to be something of a Stones historian to understand the significance of the events depicted in the comics. The text allows the more casual fans to also appreciate the book.Ultimately, I have kind of mixed feelings about this book. I can't deny that I enjoyed reading it, and the comics are well-crafted. But the idea that the comics are incapable of carrying the book on their own, that they need the prose sections to be comprehensible, makes me uneasy. It doesn't seem in keeping with the graphic novel spirit. I don't know. I’m probably overthinking it. In the end, it does work. The book was pretty decent, as I said.Some of that ambivalence may be from my feelings for the band themselves. I’ll admit that I'm a casual fan. I only own two of their albums, both of them “Greatest Hits” style compilations (Hot Rocks and More Hot Rocks if you must know). I think their glory days were pretty much the 60's and 70's. Everything since then has been more about the Rolling Stones as an Institution rather than a band. That said, they play as well as ever, and certainly know how to put on a show. If they want to keep recording and touring, more power to ‘em. Their fans certainly don't seem to mind. Anyway, this book was certainly readable, and even fun. I think it's possible to do better comics about the Rolling Stones, but these will certainly do. Kind of neutral as far as recommending it goes, but check it out if it sounds interesting to you.",3,[]
Joanne,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7099925-joanne,5,"November 20, 2021","This was a fun combo of stories, photos, and of course-comics -about The Rolling Stones. Especially intriguing to read after Sir Paul McCartney’s recent allegation that the Stones were solely a ‘blues cover band.’ According to the albeit succinct history presented in this book, that doesn’t seem like a characterization that the early Stones would disagree with; and particularly not Brian Jones, who was all about staying true to the Blues genre. Lively compendium with a variety of artists, all successful in summing up each chapter. Introduced me to some interesting blues artists and even a couple of Stones songs I didn’t know. Good fun and recommended if you’re a fan.",2,[]
Diane Hernandez,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20456668-diane-hernandez,5,"March 15, 2019","I love comics and the Rolling Stones (sorry Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) so I had to read the Rolling Stones in Comics! It tells the Rolling Stones story from its humble beginnings as a R&B cover band through its last tour. It details the issues between the band members, the drugs, the deaths, the music, and the groupies. The books states that Bill Wyman was the first person to coin the term groupies. The book is full of interesting tidbits like that. The artwork is bright and clear. The book has an innovative solution to the usual problem of trying to stuff too much information in comic book speech balloons. It has a prose introduction to each chapter. Most are about three pages long and also contain pictures of the Stones at the time period referenced in the chapter. It worked for me. Overall, the Rolling Stones in Comics! Is highly recommended for Stones fans and others who want to revisit the turbulent 1960s and 70s. 4 stars!Thanks to NBM Publishing and NetGalley for a copy in exchange for an honest review.",0,['netgalley']

Samantha,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16891475-samantha,5,"February 15, 2019","The story of The Rolling Stones isn't a new or closely guarded one. Any fan of the band has undoubtedly digested it in multiple media, ranging from book to documentary film to periodical piece. Now we have the opportunity to read the same old story in a brand new format in this comic book tale of The Rolling Stones.Given the aforementioned nod to the band's tremendous public exposure, it goes without saying that this particular version of the Stones biography doesn't tell us anything new. That said, the delivery is different, and that's not nothing.A warning needs to be extended to the reader that despite being billed as a comic book history, most of the book is actually in text form. The comic panels are interspersed between sections of pure written content, and generally provide supporting material to the text rather than actually telling the story. I would have preferred more art and less text, but generally speaking, the mix is not unpleasant. My only real gripe with the book lies in the author deciding to use multiple artists for the graphic sections of the book. Part of the problem is that some of the artists chosen are, to put it bluntly, not particularly good at art. The quality from section to section varies wildly, with some of the art clocking in as outstanding and some of it rating as borderline terrible. The use of multiple artists also creates a disjointed feel and means the book doesn't flow all that well as a whole.The quality of the written sections, too, leaves something to be desired. The humor is often unsubtle and ham-fisted, and the structure is about on par with a middle school book report. (That is, if there were ever a middle school teacher cool enough to green light a book report on The Rolling Stones). Though flawed, the product as a whole still felt like a success. The writing and the art are up and down and far from perfect even at their best moments, but the mixed media format feels like a creative triumph and the combination of the story itself and the enthusiasm of those involved in the production of the book will give you some gritty, invigorating rock and roll feels. And there's nothing more Rolling Stones than that.*I received an ARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*",0,[]

Diese hätte ich mir ein wenig authentischer gewünscht.Große Leseempfehlung für Stonies!5- / 5",0,[]
Halei | DegenerateReads ,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25328578-halei-degeneratereads,5,"March 24, 2019","4.5 Stars. Review originally at DegenerateReads - https://degeneratereads.wordpress.com...This is essentially a biography of the band told through comics, but it also includes photos of the band and pages of text giving background information on different stories in the Rolling Stones' history.As a Rolling Stones fan, I was beyond stoked to read this. Reading about how they got their start, and all the crazy things they've done since has been so fun. The writer definitely doesn't hold anything back or try to glaze over any of the less agreeable things the band members have done.There were a few times throughout reading this that I felt the writer was being a tad condescending in the way they handled certain stories, but it occurred rarely enough that it didn't effect the overall tone.The artwork has a fun, caricature-style cartoon-y look—and the artist uses dark,  monochromatic color schemes. The art itself is nothing I haven't seen before, but it doesn't take away from the reading experience, and I think ""flashier"" artwork would have distracted from the stories themselves.This comic is part of a series by NBM Comics where biographical comics are written and illustrated for different bands. So far the only other band I can find available in this series is the Beatles, but I believe more will be added later.I would recommend this to any fan of the Rolling Stones—whether your interest in them is casual or you're a hardcore fan.",0,['march-2019-haul']
Wayne McCoy,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4054541-wayne-mccoy,5,"November 10, 2019","'The Rolling Stones in Comics!' by Ceka is a combination of essays, photos and comics about one of the world's most famous rock bands.There are 21 short essays and 21 short comics by various artists. The book takes a chronological look at the origins, successes, tragedies, and drugs. There are photos from throughout the years. The comics that follow the essays pretty much rehash the essays, but it's interesting to see all the different styles of art. I confess to not being the biggest fan in the world, so not knowing a ton about the band or it's members.

Not as much a fan of the structure. There's a section where they talk about some element (really helpful) followed by about 6 pages illustrating it, by a rotating group of artists.
